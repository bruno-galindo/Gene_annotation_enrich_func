	abstract = {The European Union requires a validation of genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) for quality assurance to market the semen of young bulls. Countries such as the United States of America (USA) routinely validate GEBV internally. For practical reasons, there is interest in using standardized methods. The Interbull GEBV Test is conducted with the GEBVtest software and is an alternative to the conventional EBV validation including genomic information. New features recently added to GEBVtest software were a provision to allow countries with small populations a fairer opportunity to pass the test especially for more complex and less heritable traits. A GEBV validation was performed using the newest version of GEBVtest software with different features applied to USA dairy cattle populations. Five breeds and seven traits were tested: milk yield (MIL), fat yield (FAT), protein yield (PRO), somatic cell score (SCS), longevity (DLO) and calving interval (INT) were tested in all five breeds: Holstein (HOL), Jersey (JER), Brown Swiss (BSW), Ayrshire (RDC) and Guernsey (GUE), whereas direct mastitis (MAS) was tested for HOL. Genomic predictions, i.e., GEBV, from August 2022 were used as the full data set whereas GEBV from August 2018 were used as the reduced data set. Results varied due to population size, trait complexity, data ingestion and model differences. The HOL passed the test for all traits, except MAS due to large amounts of new data added and a model change between 2018 and 2022. The validation process for JER behaved as expected for more heritable traits (MIL, FAT, PRO and SCS), but performed poorly for more complex traits (DLO and INT). The analyses were more complicated and resulted in failures for breeds with smaller populations: BSW, RDC and GUE. The failures can be attributed to the complexity of traits, a small number of candidate bulls, and strict parameters within the GEBVtest software. Additionally, for these smaller population breeds and some traits, the parent average presented higher accuracies than GEBV. In summary, USA breeds with larger populations and traits with high heritability resulted in more stable results, whereas USA breeds with smaller populations and more complex traits are hard to validate with tests often failing. The use of TMACE-based genomic evaluations should be used when large data or model changes occur in target traits. Models that include extra regressions could also help to test for other biases and improve accuracies in small populations and/or for complex traits.},

Here we attempted to estimate the effects of ف50,000 marker haplotypes simultaneously from a limited number of phenotypic records. A genome of 1000 cM was simulated with a marker spacing of 1 cM. The markers surrounding every 1-cM region were combined into marker haplotypes. Due to ﬁnite population size (Ne ϭ 100), the marker haplotypes were in linkage disequilibrium with the QTL located between the markers. Using least squares, all haplotype effects could not be estimated simultaneously. When only the biggest effects were included, they were overestimated and the accuracy of predicting genetic values of the offspring of the recorded animals was only 0.32. Best linear unbiased prediction of haplotype effects assumed equal variances associated to each 1-cM chromosomal segment, which yielded an accuracy of 0.73, although this assumption was far from true. Bayesian methods that assumed a prior distribution of the variance associated with each chromosome segment increased this accuracy to 0.85, even when the prior was not correct. It was concluded that selection on genetic values predicted from markers could substantially increase the rate of genetic gain in animals and plants, especially if combined with reproductive techniques to shorten the generation interval.},

	abstract = {Compared with the currently widely used multi-step genomic models for genomic evaluation, single-step genomic models can provide more accurate genomic evaluation by jointly analyzing phenotypes and genotypes of all animals and can properly correct for the effect of genomic preselection on genetic evaluations. The objectives of this study were to introduce a single-step genomic model, allowing a direct estimation of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) effects, and to develop efficient computing algorithms for solving equations of the single-step SNP model. We proposed an alternative to the current single-step genomic model based on the genomic relationship matrix by including an additional step for estimating the effects of SNP markers. Our single-step SNP model allowed flexible modeling of SNP effects in terms of the number and variance of SNP markers. Moreover, our single-step SNP model included a residual polygenic effect with trait-specific variance for reducing inflation in genomic prediction. A kernel calculation of the SNP model involved repeated multiplications of the inverse of the pedigree relationship matrix of genotyped animals with a vector, for which numerical methods such as preconditioned conjugate gradients can be used. For estimating SNP effects, a special updating algorithm was proposed to separate residual polygenic effects from the SNP effects. We extended our single-step SNP model to general multipletrait cases. By taking advantage of a block-diagonal (co)variance matrix of SNP effects, we showed how to estimate multivariate SNP effects in an efficient way. A general prediction formula was derived for candidates without phenotypes, which can be used for frequent, interim genomic evaluations without running the whole genomic evaluation process. We discussed various issues related to implementation of the single-step SNP model in Holstein populations with an across-country genomic reference population.},

	abstract = {Background  Biological mechanisms affecting gametogenesis, embryo development and postnatal viability have the potential to alter Mendelian inheritance expectations resulting in observable transmission ratio distortion (TRD). Although the discovery of TRD cases have been around for a long time, the current widespread and growing use of DNA technologies in the livestock industry provides a valuable resource of large genomic data with parent–offspring genotyped trios, enabling the implementation of TRD approach. In this research, the objective is to investigate TRD using SNP-by-SNP and sliding windows approaches on 441,802 genotyped Holstein cattle and 132,991 (or 47,910 phased) autosomal SNPs.
Results  The TRD was characterized using allelic and genotypic parameterizations. Across the whole genome a total of 604 chromosomal regions showed strong significant TRD. Most (85\%) of the regions presented an allelic TRD pattern with an under-representation (reduced viability) of carrier (heterozygous) offspring or with the complete or quasi-complete absence (lethality) for homozygous individuals. On the other hand, the remaining regions with geno‑typic TRD patterns exhibited the classical recessive inheritance or either an excess or deficiency of heterozygote off‑spring. Among them, the number of most relevant novel regions with strong allelic and recessive TRD patterns were 10 and 5, respectively. In addition, functional analyses revealed candidate genes regulating key biological processes associated with embryonic development and survival, DNA repair and meiotic processes, among others, providing additional biological evidence of TRD findings.
Conclusions  Our results revealed the importance of implementing different TRD parameterizations to capture all types of distortions and to determine the corresponding inheritance pattern. Novel candidate genomic regions containing lethal alleles and genes with functional and biological consequences on fertility and pre- and post-natal viability were also identified, providing opportunities for improving breeding success in cattle.},

Given this genetic architecture, gains from marker-assisted selection (MAS) programs using only a small number of DNA markers to trace a limited number of QTL is likely to be small. This has lead to the development of alternative technology for using the available dense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) information, called genomic selection. Genomic selection uses a genome-wide panel of dense markers so that all QTL are likely to be in linkage disequilibrium with at least one SNP. The genomic breeding values are predicted to be the sum of the effect of these SNPs across the entire genome. In dairy cattle breeding, the accuracy of genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) that can be achieved and the fact that these are available early in life have lead to rapid adoption of the technology. Here, we discuss the design of experiments necessary to achieve accurate prediction of GEBV in future generations in terms of the number of markers necessary and the size of the reference population where marker effects are estimated. We also present a simple method for implementing genomic selection using a genomic relationship matrix. Future challenges discussed include using whole genome sequence data to improve the accuracy of genomic selection and management of inbreeding through genomic relationships.},

	abstract = {Significance
            The introduction of genomic selection in dairy cattle improvement programs in 2008 was expected to increase rates of genetic gain, particularly for traits with low heritabilities, such as fertility and longevity. Our analysis of the US national dairy database found that generation intervals have decreased dramatically over the past 6 y, and selection intensity for lowly heritable traits has increased considerably. Genetic trends rapidly increased for fertility, lifespan, and udder health. These results clearly demonstrate the positive impact of genomic selection in US dairy cattle, even though this technology has only been in use for a short time. This progress in US Holsteins will have a favorable impact on other populations worldwide due to the widespread dissemination of US germplasm.
          , 
            Seven years after the introduction of genomic selection in the United States, it is now possible to evaluate the impact of this technology on the population. Selection differential(s) (SD) and generation interval(s) (GI) were characterized in a four-path selection model that included sire(s) of bulls (SB), sire(s) of cows (SC), dam(s) of bulls (DB), and dam(s) of cows (DC). Changes in SD over time were estimated for milk, fat, and protein yield; somatic cell score (SCS); productive life (PL); and daughter pregnancy rate (DPR) for the Holstein breed. In the period following implementation of genomic selection, dramatic reductions were seen in GI, especially the SB and SC paths. The SB GI reduced from ∼7 y to less than 2.5 y, and the DB GI fell from about 4 y to nearly 2.5 y. SD were relatively stable for yield traits, although modest gains were noted in recent years. The most dramatic response to genomic selection was observed for the lowly heritable traits DPR, PL, and SCS. Genetic trends changed from close to zero to large and favorable, resulting in rapid genetic improvement in fertility, lifespan, and health in a breed where these traits eroded over time. These results clearly demonstrate the positive impact of genomic selection in US dairy cattle, even though this technology has only been in use for a short time. Based on the four-path selection model, rates of genetic gain per year increased from ∼50–100\% for yield traits and from threefold to fourfold for lowly heritable traits.},

Phenotypic information on carcass weight was available for 227,043 individuals from commercial farms in North Carolina and Missouri, U.S. Individuals were from a commercial cross of a Duroc sire and a dam resulting from a Landrace and Large White cross. Genotypic information was available for 8232 animals with 33,581 SNPs. The pedigree ﬁle contained a total of 553,448 animals. A threshold of 78 on the Temperature Humidity Index (THI) was used to signify heat stress. A two-trait analysis was used with the phenotypes heat stress (Trait One) and non-heat stress (Trait Two). Variance components were calculated via AIREML and breeding values were calculated using single step GBLUP (ssGBLUP). The heritability for Traits One and Two were calculated at 0.25 and 0.20, respectively, and the genetic correlation was calculated as 0.63. Validation was calculated for 163 genotyped sires with progeny in the last generation. The benchmark was the GEBV with complete data, and the accuracy was determined as the correlation between the GEBV of the reduced and complete data for the validation sires. Weighted ssGBLUP did not increase the accuracies. Both methods showed a maximum accuracy of 0.32 for Trait One and 0.54 for Trait Two. Manhattan Plots for Trait One, Trait Two, and the difference between the two were created from the results of the two-trait analysis. Windows explaining more than 0.8\% of the genetic variance were isolated. Chromosomes 1 and 14 showed peaks in the difference between the two traits. The genetic correlation suggests a different mechanism for Hot Carcass Weight under heat stress. The GWAS results show that both traits are highly polygenic, with only a few genomic regions explaining more than 1\% of variance.},

	abstract = {The European Union requires a validation of genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) for quality assurance to market the semen of young bulls. Countries such as the United States of America (USA) routinely validate GEBV internally. For practical reasons, there is interest in using standardized methods. The Interbull GEBV Test is conducted with the GEBVtest software and is an alternative to the conventional EBV validation including genomic information. New features recently added to GEBVtest software were a provision to allow countries with small populations a fairer opportunity to pass the test especially for more complex and less heritable traits. A GEBV validation was performed using the newest version of GEBVtest software with different features applied to USA dairy cattle populations. Five breeds and seven traits were tested: milk yield (MIL), fat yield (FAT), protein yield (PRO), somatic cell score (SCS), longevity (DLO) and calving interval (INT) were tested in all five breeds: Holstein (HOL), Jersey (JER), Brown Swiss (BSW), Ayrshire (RDC) and Guernsey (GUE), whereas direct mastitis (MAS) was tested for HOL. Genomic predictions, i.e., GEBV, from August 2022 were used as the full data set whereas GEBV from August 2018 were used as the reduced data set. Results varied due to population size, trait complexity, data ingestion and model differences. The HOL passed the test for all traits, except MAS due to large amounts of new data added and a model change between 2018 and 2022. The validation process for JER behaved as expected for more heritable traits (MIL, FAT, PRO and SCS), but performed poorly for more complex traits (DLO and INT). The analyses were more complicated and resulted in failures for breeds with smaller populations: BSW, RDC and GUE. The failures can be attributed to the complexity of traits, a small number of candidate bulls, and strict parameters within the GEBVtest software. Additionally, for these smaller population breeds and some traits, the parent average presented higher accuracies than GEBV. In summary, USA breeds with larger populations and traits with high heritability resulted in more stable results, whereas USA breeds with smaller populations and more complex traits are hard to validate with tests often failing. The use of TMACE-based genomic evaluations should be used when large data or model changes occur in target traits. Models that include extra regressions could also help to test for other biases and improve accuracies in small populations and/or for complex traits.},

	abstract = {Background: Natural and artificial selection leads to changes in certain regions of the genome resulting in selection signatures that can reveal genes associated with the selected traits. Selection signatures may be identified using different methodologies, of which some are based on detecting contiguous sequences of homozygous identical-bydescent haplotypes, called runs of homozygosity (ROH), or estimating fixation index (FST) of genomic windows that indicates genetic differentiation. This study aimed to identify selection signatures in a paternal broiler TT line at generations 7th and 16th of selection and to investigate the genes annotated in these regions as well as the biological pathways involved. For such purpose, ROH and FST-based analysis were performed using whole genome sequence of twenty-eight chickens from two different generations.
Results: ROH analysis identified homozygous regions of short and moderate size. Analysis of ROH patterns revealed regions commonly shared among animals and changes in ROH abundance and size between the two generations. Results also suggest that whole genome sequencing (WGS) outperforms SNPchip data avoiding overestimation of ROH size and underestimation of ROH number; however, sequencing costs can limited the number of animals analyzed. FSTbased analysis revealed genetic differentiation in several genomic windows. Annotation of the consensus regions of ROH and FST windows revealed new and previously identified genes associated with traits of economic interest, such as APOB, IGF1, IGFBP2, POMC, PPARG, and ZNF423. Over-representation analysis of the genes resulted in biological terms of skeletal muscle, matrilin proteins, adipose tissue, hyperglycemia, diabetes, Salmonella infections and tyrosine.
Conclusions: Identification of ROH and FST-based analyses revealed selection signatures in TT line and genes that have important role in traits of economic interest. Changes in the genome of the chickens were observed between the 7th and 16th generations showing that ancient and recent selection in TT line may have acted over genomic regions affecting diseases and performance traits.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The wide use of genomic information has enabled the identification of lethal recessive alleles that are the major genetic causes of reduced conception rates, longer calving intervals, or lower survival for live-born animals. This study was carried out to screen the Nellore cattle genome for lethal recessive haplotypes based on deviation from the expected population homozygosity, and to test SNP markers surrounding the lethal haplotypes region for association with heifer rebreeding (HR), post-natal mortality (PNM) and stayability (STAY). This approach requires genotypes only from apparently normal individuals and not from affected embryos. A total of 62,022 animals were genotyped and imputed to a high-density panel (777,962 SNP markers). Expected numbers of homozygous individuals were calculated, and the probabilities of observing 0 homozygotes was obtained. Deregressed genomic breeding values [(G)EBVs] were used in a GWAS to identify candidate genes and biological mechanisms affecting HR, STAY and PNM. In the functional analyses, genes within 100 kb down and upstream of each significant SNP marker, were researched. Thirty haplotypes had high expected frequency, while no homozygotes were observed. Most of the alleles present in these haplotypes had a negative mean effect for PNM, HR and STAY. The GWAS revealed significant SNP markers involved in different physiological mechanisms, leading to harmful effect on the three traits. The functional analysis revealed 26 genes enriched for 19 GO terms. Most of the GO terms found for biological processes, molecular functions and pathways were related to tissue development and the immune system. More phenotypes underlying these putative regions in this population could be the subject of future investigation. Tests to find putative lethal haplotype carriers could help breeders to eliminate them from the population or manage matings in order to avoid homozygous.},

Most research is on classical quantitative genetics published in Brazilian journals with a lower impact (impact factor lower than the world mean of one). Beef cattle are the main species researched, with dairy cattle and sheep also present. Less information is available on goats, poultry, swine, and equines. Research must expand to regions outside São Paulo State and beyond classical quantitative genetics. Publishing should be directed towards international journals and an increase in international collaborations. We also use the data to discuss and suggest new research areas to improve Brazil´s food security and increase sustainable animal production.},

With “optimal” scaling, reliabilities were higher and the inflation of EBV was lower compared to a multi-step approach. Accurate genomic evaluations can be obtained by modifying the relationship matrices in current evaluation systems.

	abstract = {Over the past 100 yr, the range of traits considered for genetic selection in dairy cattle populations has progressed to meet the demands of both industry and society. At the turn of the 20th century, dairy farmers were interested in increasing milk production; however, a systematic strategy for selection was not available. Organized milk performance recording took shape, followed quickly by conformation scoring. Methodological advances in both genetic theory and statistics around the middle of the century, together with technological innovations in computing, paved the way for powerful multitrait analyses. As more sophisticated analytical techniques for traits were developed and incorporated into selection programs, production began to increase rapidly, and the wheels of genetic progress began to turn. By the end of the century, the focus of selection had moved away from being purely production oriented toward a more balanced breeding goal. This shift occurred partly due to increasing health and fertility issues and partly due to societal pressure and welfare concerns. Traits encompassing longevity, fertility, calving, health, and workability have now been integrated into selection indices. Current research focuses on fitness, health, welfare, milk quality, and environmental sustainability, underlying the concentrated emphasis on a more comprehensive breeding goal. In the future, onfarm sensors, data loggers, precision measurement techniques, and other technological aids will provide even more data for use in selection, and the difficulty will lie not in measuring phenotypes but rather in choosing which traits to select for.},

Through the relationship matrix, breeding values are ex{\textasciitilde} pressed as linear functions of breeding values of base population animals and subsequent Mendelian sampling contributions that are unaffected by selection and account for inbreeding. Correct definition of the base population is important. With finite numbers of loci, an animal model does not account for changes in genetic variance due to changes in gene frequency. Genotypic values can be expressed in terms of separate gametic contributions of each parent by gametic models, and a gametic relationship matrix can be constructed. With dominance, use of an animal model with the dominance relationship matrix leads to BLUP of dominance genetic merit if number of loci is sufficiently large and no inbreeding occurs. With inbreeding, inclusion of the dominancc relationship matrix (evcn if modified to account for inbreeding contributions) does not account for inbreeding depression. However, effects of inbreeding depression might be accommodated by including the inbreeding coefficient as a covariate in the model.},

	abstract = {Quantitative traits—be they morphological or physiological characters, aspects of behavior, or genome-level features such as the amount of RNA or protein expression for a specific gene—usually show considerable variation within and among populations. Quantitative genetics, also referred to as the genetics of complex traits, is the study of such characters and is based on mathematical models of evolution in which many genes influence the trait and in which non-genetic factors may also be important.
              Evolution and Selection of Quantitative Traits
              presents a holistic treatment of the subject, showing the interplay between theory and data with extensive discussions on statistical issues relating to the estimation of the biologically relevant parameters for these models. Quantitative genetics is viewed as the bridge between complex mathematical models of trait evolution and real-world data, and the authors have clearly framed their treatment as such. This is the second volume in a planned trilogy that summarizes the modern field of quantitative genetics, informed by empirical observations from wide-ranging fields (agriculture, evolution, ecology, and human biology) as well as population genetics, statistical theory, mathematical modeling, genetics, and genomics. Whilst volume 1 (1998) dealt with the genetics of such traits, the main focus of volume 2 is on their evolution, with a special emphasis on detecting selection (ranging from the use of genomic and historical data through to ecological field data) and examining its consequences. This extensive work of reference is suitable for graduate level students as well as professional researchers (both empiricists and theoreticians) in the fields of evolutionary biology, genetics, and genomics. It will also be of particular relevance and use to plant and animal breeders, human geneticists, and statisticians.},

	abstract = {Cattle temperament has been considered by farmers as a key breeding goal due to its relevance for cattlemen’s safety, animal welfare, resilience, and longevity and its association with many economically important traits (e.g., production and meat quality). The definition of proper statistical models, accurate variance component estimates, and knowledge on the genetic background of the indicator trait evaluated are of great importance for accurately predicting the genetic merit of breeding animals. Therefore, 266,029 American Angus cattle with yearling temperament records (1–6 score) were used to evaluate statistical models and estimate variance components; investigate the association of sex and farm management with temperament; assess the weighted correlation of estimated breeding values for temperament and productive, reproductive efficiency and resilience traits; and perform a weighted single-step genome-wide association analysis using 69,559 animals genotyped for 54,609 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Sex and extrinsic factors were significantly associated with temperament, including conception type, age of dam, birth season, and additional animal–human interactions. Similar results were observed among models including only the direct additive genetic effect and when adding other maternal effects. Estimated heritability of temperament was equal to 0.39 on the liability scale. Favorable genetic correlations were observed between temperament and other relevant traits, including growth, feed efficiency, meat quality, and reproductive traits. The highest approximated genetic correlations were observed between temperament and growth traits (weaning weight, 0.28; yearling weight, 0.28). Altogether, we identified 11 genomic regions, located across nine chromosomes including BTAX, explaining 3.33\% of the total additive genetic variance. The candidate genes identified were enriched in pathways related to vision, which could be associated with reception of stimulus and/or cognitive abilities. This study encompasses large and diverse phenotypic, genomic, and pedigree datasets of US Angus cattle. Yearling temperament is a highly heritable and polygenic trait that can be improved through genetic selection. Direct selection for temperament is not expected to result in unfavorable responses on other relevant traits due to the favorable or low genetic correlations observed. In summary, this study contributes to a better understanding of the impact of maternal effects, extrinsic factors, and various genomic regions associated with yearling temperament in North American Angus cattle.},

The goat genomics related to the candidate gene approach is now being used to recognize molecular mechanisms that have different expressions of growth, reproductive, milk, wool, and disease resistance. The appropriate literature on this topic has been reviewed in this article. Several genetic characterization attempts of different goats have reported the existence of genotypic and morphological variations between different goat populations. As a result, different whole-genome sequences along with annotated gene sequences, gene function, and other genomic information of different goats are available in different databases. The main objective of this review is to search the genes associated with economic traits in goats. More than 271 candidate genes have been discovered in goats. Candidate genes influence the physiological pathway, metabolism, and expression of phenotypes. These genes have different functions on economically important traits. Some genes have pleiotropic effect for expression of phenotypic traits. Hence, recognizing candidate genes and their mutations that cause variations in gene expression and phenotype of an economic trait can help breeders look for genetic markers for specific economic traits. The availability of reference whole-genome assembly of goats, annotated genes, and transcriptomics makes comparative genomics a useful tool for systemic genetic upgradation. Identification and characterization of trait-associated sequence variations and gene will provide powerful means to give positive influences for future goat breeding program.},

	abstract = {The candidate gene approach is now exploited in sheep and goats, aiming to identify the molecular mechanisms, which make milks of different quality. In this paper, the relevant literature on this topic is reviewed. The most intensively analysed genes are milk protein genes, where, up to now, major effects were assessed for the αs1-casein, in both sheep and goats. For the αs2-casein, only in goats it was possible to associate the detected alleles with different casein synthesis levels: normal, low or null. For the β-casein, several variants were detected in goats, some of which are associated with a very low casein content, but extensive studies on the frequency and the effect of such variants are still to be conducted. The k-casein was thoroughly analysed at the genomic level in many breeds of goats, and 16 alleles were identified. However, no positive association of any allele with milk characteristics was so far reported. Conflicting results were obtained on the effect of β-lactoglobulin in sheep, while, in goats, variants were also extensively studied, but a positive association was found only with milk yield. Also the structure of the α-lactalbumin gene was partially investigated, but its possible effect on milk quality is still uncertain either in sheep or goats. Other candidate genes, that are being now extensively studied, are the genes encoding enzymes directly involved in fatty acid metabolism: ACACA in sheep; SCD in sheep and goats; LPL and DGAT1 in sheep, for which preliminary results of their effect on milk quality are given. The list of the studied candidate genes, that are being investigated according to their function, include FABP3, AMY, CGN, ACP6, ANAXA9, AMY2, gGH and Lactoferrin, although research on these genes is still at the beginning. It is expected, that new candidate genes will be identified by microarray analysis on total mRNA of the mammary gland, and that further field studies will be carried on, to demonstrate the association between genetic variants and milk quality. Nutritional and functional properties of milk still need to be more deeply investigated.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Clustering of individuals into populations on the basis of multilocus genotypes is informative in a variety of settings. In population-genetic clustering algorithms, such as BAPS, STRUCTURE and TESS, individual multilocus genotypes are partitioned over a set of clusters, often using unsupervised approaches that involve stochastic simulation. As a result, replicate cluster analyses of the same data may produce several distinct solutions for estimated cluster membership coefficients, even though the same initial conditions were used. Major differences among clustering solutions have two main sources: (1) ‘label switching’ of clusters across replicates, caused by the arbitrary way in which clusters in an unsupervised analysis are labeled, and (2) ‘genuine multimodality,’ truly distinct solutions across replicates.Results: To facilitate the interpretation of population-genetic clustering results, we describe three algorithms for aligning multiple replicate analyses of the same data set. We have implemented these algorithms in the computer program CLUMPP (CLUster Matching and Permutation Program). We illustrate the use of CLUMPP by aligning the cluster membership coefficients from 100 replicate cluster analyses of 600 chickens from 20 different breeds.Availability:  CLUMPP is freely available at http://rosenberglab.bioinformatics.med.umich.edu/clumpp.htmlContact:  mjakob@umich.edu},

	doi = {10.15744/2393-9060.3.401},
	abstract = {An important component present in goat’s milk is called biorganic sodium. One of the highest sources of biorganic sodium is goat’s milk. Arthritis is thought to be caused by lack of this mineral. The human stomach stores more sodium than any other organ. Therefore, at least some digestive disturbances are thought to be caused by lack of biorganic sodium. The lack of this mineral inhibits the stomach’s production of needed enzymes. This in turn causes bloating, and even ulcers. The typical American diet of processed foods, sodas, sugar, and alcohol greatly depletes the body of biorganic sodium (http://www.goodoledays.weebly.com/benefits-of-goats-milk.html).
One of the most important components of goat milk in terms of proven health benefits is the percentage of medium chain fatty acids. The first three of these Medium Chain Triglycerides (MCT), 6:0, 8:0 and 10:0 are known as caproic, caprylic and capric acid, respectively. These three fatty acids comprise 15\% of the total of goat milk fat, versus only 5\% for cow’s milk. It is also these three compounds that give improperly handled goat milk its characteristic off-taste and smell. As a whole, goat milk has about twice the MCT as cow’s milk 35\% compared to 17\% (http://www.goodoledays.weebly.com/benefits-of-goats milk.html).
MCT have the triple effects on the human health; a) lowering cholesterol deposition in the arteries, and b) dissolving and preventing cholesterol deposits in the gallstones. The health benefits of MCT are widely known by the medical community, which uses them as treatment for a variety of conditions including malabsorption syndrome, coronary diseases, cystic fibrosis, intestinal disorders, pre-mature infant nutrition, gallstones, steatorrhoea, chyluria, hyperlipoproteinaemia, childhood epilepsy and many others (http://www.goodoledays.weebly .com/benefits-of-goats milk.html).},

The review covers STRUCTURE's most commonly used ancestry and frequency models, plus an overview of the main applications of the software in human genetics including case-control association studies (CCAS), population genetics, and forensic analysis. The review is accompanied by supplementary material providing a step-by-step guide to running STRUCTURE.Methods: With reference to a worked example, we explore the effects of changing the principal analysis parameters on STRUCTURE results when analyzing a uniform set of human genetic data. Use of the supporting software: CLUMPP and distruct is detailed and we provide an overview and worked example of STRAT software, applicable to CCAS.Conclusion: The guide offers a simplified view of how STRUCTURE, CLUMPP, distruct, and STRAT can be applied to provide researchers with an informed choice of parameter settings and supporting software when analyzing their own genetic data.},

	abstract = {Genomic selection (GS) is now practiced successfully across many species. However, many questions remain, such as longterm effects, estimations of genomic parameters, robustness of genome-wide association study (GWAS) with small and large datasets, and stability of genomic predictions. This study summarizes presentations from the authors at the 2020 American Society of Animal Science (ASAS) symposium. The focus of many studies until now is on linkage disequilibrium between two loci. Ignoring higher-level equilibrium may lead to phantom dominance and epistasis. The Bulmer effect leads to a reduction of the additive variance; however, the selection for increased recombination rate can release anew genetic variance. With genomic information, estimates of genetic parameters may be biased by genomic preselection, but costs of estimation can increase drastically due to the dense form of the genomic information. To make the computation of estimates feasible, genotypes could be retained only for the most important animals, and methods of estimation should use algorithms that can recognize dense blocks in sparse matrices. GWASs using small genomic datasets frequently find many marker-trait associations, whereas studies using much bigger datasets find only a few. Most of the current tools use very simple models for GWAS, possibly causing artifacts. These models are adequate for large datasets where pseudophenotypes such as deregressed proofs indirectly account for important effects for traits of interest. Artifacts arising in GWAS with small datasets can be minimized by using data from all animals (whether genotyped or not), realistic models, and methods that account for population structure. Recent developments permit the computation of P-values from genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP), where models can be arbitrarily complex but restricted to genotyped animals only, and single-step GBLUP that also uses phenotypes from ungenotyped animals. Stability was an important part of nongenomic evaluations, where genetic predictions were stable in the absence of new data even with low prediction accuracies. Unfortunately, genomic evaluations for such animals change because all animals with genotypes are connected. A top-ranked animal can easily drop in the next evaluation, causing a crisis of confidence in genomic evaluations. While correlations between consecutive genomic evaluations are high, outliers can have differences as high as 1 SD. A solution to fluctuating genomic evaluations is to base selection decisions on groups of animals. Although many issues in GS have been solved, many new issues that require additional research continue to surface.},

	abstract = {This study aimed to assess the milk production data for New Zealand dairy goats in either a standard lactation (SL; ≤ 305 d in milk) or extended lactation (EL; {\textgreater} 305 and ≤ 670 d in milk) using a random regression (RR) with third and fifth order Legendre polynomials, respectively. Persistency of EL was defined as (B/A) × 100, where A was the accumulated yield from d 1 to 305, and B was the accumulated yield from d 366 to 670. On average, goats in a SL produced 1183 kg milk, 37 kg fat, 37 kg protein and 54 kg lactose. The average production of milk, fat, protein, and lactose in EL were 2,473 kg, 78 kg, 79 kg and 112 kg, respectively. The average persistence's for milk, fat, protein, and lactose yields during EL were 117, 117, 122 and 114\%, respectively. The relative prediction errors were close to 10\% and the concordance correlation coefficients {\textgreater} 0.92, indicating that the RR model with Legendre polynomials is adequate for modeling lactation curves for both SL and EL. Total yields and persistency were analyzed with a mixed model that included the fixed effects (year, month of kidding, parity, and proportion of Saanen) as covariates and the random effects of animal and residual errors. Effects of year, month-of-kidding, and parity were significant (P {\textless} 0.01) on the total yields of milk, fat, protein and lactose for both SL and EL. The total milk yield of first-parity goats with a SL was 946 kg and the total milk yield of second-parity goats with a SL was 1,284 kg, making a total of 2,230 kg over 2 years. The total milk yield of a first-parity goat with an EL was 2,140 kg. Thus, on average, a goat with SL for the first and second parity produced 90 kg more milk than a first-parity goat subjected to extended lactation. However, a second-parity goat subjected to an extended lactation produced 43 kg more milk (2,639 kg) than a goat with SL following the second and third parity (1,284 kg + 1312 kg). These data, along with the various other benefits of EL (e.g., fewer offspring born and reduce risk of mastitis, lameness, metabolic problems in early lactation), indicate that EL as a management strategy holds the potential to improve dairy goat longevity and lifetime efficiency without compromising milk production.},

With several African cichlid genome projects being in progress, a promising set of closely related genomes is emerging, which is expected to serve as a valuable data base to solve questions on genotype-phenotype relations. The mitochondrial (mt) genomes presented here are the first results of the assembly and annotation process for two closely related but eco-morphologically highly distinct Lake Tanganyika cichlids, Petrochromis trewavasae and Tropheus moorii. The genomic sequences comprise 16,588 bp (P. trewavasae) and 16,590 bp (T. moorii), and exhibit the typical mitochondrial structure, with 13 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNA genes, 22 tRNA genes, and a non-coding control region. Analyses confirmed that the two species are very closely related with an overall sequence similarity of 96\%. We analyzed the newly generated sequences in the phylogenetic context of 21 published labroid fish mitochondrial genomes. Consistent with other vertebrates, the D-loop region was found to evolve faster than protein-coding genes, which in turn are followed by the rRNAs; the tRNAs vary greatly in the rate of sequence evolution, but on average evolve the slowest. Within the group of coding genes, ND6 evolves most rapidly. Codon usage is similar among examined cichlid tribes and labroid families; although a slight shift in usage patterns down the gene tree could be observed. Despite having a clearly different nucleotide composition, ND6 showed a similar codon usage. C-terminal ends of Cox1 exhibit variations, where the varying number of amino acids is related to the structure of the obtained phylogenetic tree. This variation may be of functional relevance for Cox1 synthesis.},

We use a linear mixed model for analysis of binary traits and transform the estimates to a liability scale by adjusting both for scale and for ascertainment of the case samples. We show by theory and simulation that the method is unbiased.

	abstract = {Abstract: The Paranapanema River is an important, extensively explored tributary of the Upper Paraná River basin. The fish fauna of the Paranapanema River has been investigated since the 1990s; however, no study has characterized the richness of fish species throughout the basin, including the main channel of the river, marginal lagoons, its tributaries, and sub-tributaries. Thus, we performed a review with 90 independent studies conducted at the upper, middle, and lower sections of the basin. We recorded 225 species, of which 165 were native, and 60 were non-native. We found that 77\% of the species within the basin are composed by Siluriformes and Characiformes. Cichliformes had a significant number of non-native species established in impoundment sections of the basin. Incidence-Based Estimators (Bootstrap and Chao 2) demonstrated that the richness of native species is still underestimated. Some native (e.g., Hypostomus ancistroides) and non-native species (e.g., Plagioscion squamosissimus) are widely distributed in the basin, while others had a more restricted distribution. Among the registered species, the family Bryconidae had the highest number of representatives with threatened conservation status. In addition, we observed that the Capivara Reservoir and its tributaries were the most sampled regions, with the majority of studies performed in the Lower Paranapanema basin. The species richness recorded in large tributaries, such as Tibagi, Cinzas, Congonhas, and Pirapó rivers is critical for maintaining the fish fauna in the Paranapanema River. Our contribution may be used to support management actions and conservation strategies, as well as to indicate regions in the basin that need to be better inventoried.},

Here we provide complete species lists for 3119 drainage basins covering more than 80\% of the Earth surface using 14953 fish species inhabiting permanently or occasionally freshwater systems. The database results from an extensive survey of native and non-native freshwater fish species distribution based on 1436 published papers, books, grey literature and web-based sources. Alone or in combination with further datasets on species biological and ecological characteristics and their evolutionary history, this database represents a highly valuable source of information for further studies on freshwater macroecology, macroevolution, biogeography and conservation.},

Taxon: Strictly freshwater species of actinopterygian fish (i.e. excluding marine and amphidromous fish families). Methods: We based our bioregionalization on a global database of freshwater fish species occurrences in drainage basins, which, after filtering, includes 11,295 species in 2,581 basins. On the basis of this dataset, we generated a bipartite (basin‐species) network upon which we applied a hierarchical clustering algorithm (the Map Equation) to detect regions. We tested the robustness of regions with a sensitivity analysis. We identified transition zones between major regions with the participation coefficient, indicating the degree to which a basin has species from multiple regions. Results: Our bioregionalization scheme showed two major supercontinental regions (Old World and New World, 50\% species of the world and 99.96\% endemics each). Nested within these two supercontinental regions lie six major regions (Nearctic, Neotropical, Palearctic, Ethiopian, Sino‐Oriental and Australian) with extremely high degrees of endemism (above 96\% except for the Palearctic). Transition zones between regions were of limited extent compared to other groups of organisms. We identified numerous subregions with high diversity and endemism in tropical areas (e.g. Neotropical), and a few large subregions with low diversity and endemism at high latitudes (e.g. Palearctic).},

            In the Neotropics, freshwater streams harbour high fish diversity and are constantly threatened by anthropogenic disturbance. However, there are few studies on the genetic diversity of fish populations inhabiting these streams. We aimed to assess, based on microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA markers, the population structure and genetic diversity of the suckermouth catfish, Hypostomus ancistroides, a Neotropical species widely distributed across the Upper Paraná River Basin in South America. Twenty-five locations were sampled, distributed across 18 sites in six tributary streams and another seven sites in the main river channel. Our analyses revealed a spatial heterogeneity in genetic diversity within the basin, indicating fine-scale genetic structuring. Samples from all streams showed exclusive haplotypes and private alleles, reinforcing the importance of preserving the tributaries for the conservation of the genetic diversity of the studied populations. The fine-scale genetic structuring of H. ancistroides is probably related to the limited displacement capacity of this species.},

	abstract = {Brycon nattereri is an endangered Neotropical fish reported along conserved stretches of the upper Paraná, Tocantins and São Francisco rivers. Populations of this species have been very rare in some Paraná River sub basins. This study analyzes the genetic diversity and population structure of B. nattereri in a restricted area of occurrence recently identified in upper Paraná River basin. Seven microsatellite loci and 497 bp of D-Loop mitochondrial region were examined in 92 individuals from four points along the area of occurrence. Both molecular markers indicated a single population distributed along a stretch of the river approximately 80 km long. Although some of the data suggest an ancient bottleneck, current levels of genetic diversity (HE = 0.574 and h = 0.616) were similar to those of other species of the genus Brycon. The results suggest that the population of B. nattereri has been able to maintain satisfactory levels of genetic diversity, in spite of the small area of occurrence. These data have highlighted an important conservation area and action may prove essential to improve the quality of the environment, and especially the water and riparian plant life, if the area is to be managed and conserved efficiently.},

Our database includes documented distributions of 4214 species (both Amazonian and from surrounding basins), compiled from published information plus original data from ichthyological collections. Our results show that the Amazon basin comprises the most diverse regional assemblage of freshwater fishes in the world, with 2716 valid species (1696 of which are endemic) representing 529 genera, 60 families, and 18 orders. These data permit a view of the diversity and distribution of Amazonian fishes on a basinwide scale, which in turn allows the identification of congruent biogeographical patterns, here defined as the overlapping distributions of two or more lineages (species or monophyletic groups). We recognize 20 distinct distributional patterns of Amazonian fishes, which are herein individually delimited, named, and diagnosed. Not all these patterns are associated with identifiable geographical barriers, and some may result from ecological constraints. All the major Amazonian subdrainages fit into more than one biogeographical pattern. This fact reveals the complex history of hydrographical basins and shows that modern basin-defined units contribute relatively little as explanatory factors for the present distributions of Amazonian fishes. An understanding of geomorphological processes and associated paleographic landscape changes provides a far better background for interpreting observed patterns. Our results are expected to provide a framework for future studies on the diversification and historical biogeography of the Amazonian aquatic biota.},

Individuals in the sample are assigned (probabilistically) to populations, or jointly to two or more populations if their genotypes indicate that they are admixed. Our model does not assume a particular mutation process, and it can be applied to most of the commonly used genetic markers, provided that they are not closely linked. Applications of our method include demonstrating the presence of population structure, assigning individuals to populations, studying hybrid zones, and identifying migrants and admixed individuals. We show that the method can produce highly accurate assignments using modest numbers of loci—e.g., seven microsatellite loci in an example using genotype data from an endangered bird species.

A recent Bayesian algorithm implemented in the software STRUCTURE allows the identification of such groups. However, the ability of this algorithm to detect the true number of clusters (K) in a sample of individuals when patterns of dispersal among populations are not homogeneous has not been tested. The goal of this study is to carry out such tests, using various dispersal scenarios from data generated with an individual-based model. We found that in most cases the estimated 'log probability of data' does not provide a correct estimation of the number of clusters, K. However, using an ad hoc statistic DeltaK based on the rate of change in the log probability of data between successive K values, we found that STRUCTURE accurately detects the uppermost hierarchical level of structure for the scenarios we tested. As might be expected, the results are sensitive to the type of genetic marker used (AFLP vs. microsatellite), the number of loci scored, the number of populations sampled, and the number of individuals typed in each sample.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Clustering of individuals into populations on the basis of multilocus genotypes is informative in a variety of settings. In population-genetic clustering algorithms, such as BAPS, STRUCTURE and TESS, individual multilocus genotypes are partitioned over a set of clusters, often using unsupervised approaches that involve stochastic simulation. As a result, replicate cluster analyses of the same data may produce several distinct solutions for estimated cluster membership coefficients, even though the same initial conditions were used. Major differences among clustering solutions have two main sources: (1) ‘label switching’ of clusters across replicates, caused by the arbitrary way in which clusters in an unsupervised analysis are labeled, and (2) ‘genuine multimodality,’ truly distinct solutions across replicates.Results: To facilitate the interpretation of population-genetic clustering results, we describe three algorithms for aligning multiple replicate analyses of the same data set. We have implemented these algorithms in the computer program CLUMPP (CLUster Matching and Permutation Program). We illustrate the use of CLUMPP by aligning the cluster membership coefficients from 100 replicate cluster analyses of 600 chickens from 20 different breeds.Availability:  CLUMPP is freely available at http://rosenberglab.bioinformatics.med.umich.edu/clumpp.htmlContact:  mjakob@umich.edu},

The three ways of adjustment were compared by the percentage of convergence and the average of the mean square errors (MSE) and coefficients of determination adjusted (R2adj). The average of MSE and R2aj were very similar in the three cases of residual structure. However, the model with IE-AR1 residual structure showed a higher rate of convergence, which is an advantage, as it allows a greater number of animals are evaluated for their lactation curve.

Body weights were predicted from heart girths measured at or before the first test day after calving. Data analyzed were 23,052 records from 8575 cows, daughters of 681 bulls. Heritabilities and breeding values were estimated using the multiple-trait, derivative-free REML programs and a single-trait repeatability model. Breeding values of cows were averaged by and regressed on birth year to estimate genetic trends. Genetic correlations between traits were estimated by correlating breeding values. Estimates of heritability were 0.25 for 3.7\% FCM, 0.28 for fat yield, 0.03 for days open, and 0.17 for predicted body weight. Unfavorable genetic relationships were found between yields and days open and between yields and body weight. Genetically, cows that were heavier after calving produced less milk and fat but conceived earlier than smaller cows. Genetic changes in yields and days open were greater for cows born after 1970, but the greatest genetic changes were after 1980 (FCM, 94.7kg/yr; fat yield, 3.46kg/yr; days open, 1.1 d/yr). Breeding values for body weight increased for cows born from 1950 to 1970, decreased until 1980, and increased for later parities. The results of our study suggest that AI organizations may need to include fertility traits in progeny testing and relax the emphasis on increased body weight.},

	abstract = {Lactation persistency (LP) has been neglected over time in genetic evaluations of dairy goats. The main reason for this is the difficulty to infer about the lactation curve shape. However, some lactations models such as Wood seem to be appropriate to provide persistency estimates under biological viewpoints. The aim of this study was to fit the Wood lactation model as well as to calculate and evaluate LP as selection criteria in dairy goat breeding programs through genetic parameters estimates. A total of 23,265 first lactation test day milk yield observations from 900 animals were used. The Wood random regression model was primarily fitted to estimate the lactation curve parameters (a, b and c), and then LP and total milk yield (TMY). Posteriorly, a multi-trait animal model was fitted considering simultaneously LP and TMY. The heritability estimates were 0.31 and 0.04 for TMY and LP, respectively. Based on the low LP heritability, selection based only on this trait might be inefficient. In conclusion, the results of this study suggests that selecting for high milk yields might result in high persistency since the genetic correlation between LP and TMY was moderate (0.39).},

	abstract = {A persistent lactation is dependent on maintaining the number and activity of milk secreting cells with advancing lactation. When dairy cows are milked twice daily, the increase in milk yield from parturition to peak lactation is due to increased secretory activity per cell rather than to accretion of additional epithelial cells. After peak lactation, declining milk yield is due to loss of mammary epithelial cells by apoptosis. During lactation, only 0.3\% of mammary cells proliferate in a 24-h period. Yet this proliferative rate is sufficient to replace most mammary epithelial cells by the end of lactation. Management practices can influence lactation persistency. Administration of bovine somatotropin may enhance persistency by increasing cell proliferation and turnover, or by reducing the rate of apoptosis. Increased photoperiod may also increase persistency of lactation by mechanisms that are as yet undefined. Increased milking frequency during the first weeks of lactation increases milk yield, even after return to less frequent milking, with increases of approximately 8\% over the entire lactation. A mammary cell proliferation response to frequent milking during early lactation appears to be involved. Conversely, advanced pregnancy, infrequent milking, and mastitis increase death of epithelial cells by apoptosis. Regulation of mammary cell renewal provides a key to increasing persistency. Investigations to characterize epithelial cells that serve as the proliferative population in the bovine mammary gland have been initiated. Epithelial cells that stain lightly in histological sections are evident through all phases of mammary development and secretion and account for nearly all proliferation in the prepubertal gland. Characterization of these cells may provide a means to regulate mammary cell proliferation and thus to enhance persistency, reduce the effects of mastitis, and decrease the necessity for a dry period.},

	abstract = {Thirty-six goats: 15 Alpine (AG), 13 Saanen (SG) and 8 Anglo-Nubian (ANG) were used to evaluate dry matter intake (DMI), body weight (BW) changes and milk production to validate Wood's model in lactation curves. The kids pre-weaning weight, weaning weight (WW) and daily weight gain (DWG) were determined. Milk production was measured daily for a period of 90 d. The DWG was quantified daily, while BW was recorded weekly. Performance of 48 kids (20 AG, 15 SG and 13 ANG), aged 15 d were evaluated. Wood's model was utilised to describe goat's lactation curve in the different studied goat breeds. Milk production was differed between breeds and according to the number of kids suckled (P {\textless} 0.05). Both of DMI and BW showed a linear increase (P {\textless} 0.05) during the studied period. Both of WW and DWG were unaffected by type of kidding and breed and were higher in males than in females. It is suggested that equation of Wood's model is adequate to describe the lactation curve in studied goat breeds. The ANG and AG breeds versus SG had more persistence for milk production which was higher for those with single type of birth than those with twins.},

Subclass means of milk production for 100 3-d groups were smoothed and used to estimate parameters of a diphasic function, which is the sum of two logistic functions. Characteristics for each phase of the lactation curve (initial, peak, and 305-d yields, time of peak, and duration of phase), which are functions of parameters of the diphasic function, were then analyzed using a linear model including breed, parity, season, and mean of measure of production as a covariate, weighted by the number of observations in each subclass. Breed had little effect on the shape of the lactation curve in dairy goats. Parity affected primarily characteristics of the second phase of lactation. Season of kidding had the most consistent effect on the lactation curve: affecting characteristics of each phase. Measure of production affected characteristics of the second phase more than those of the first phase. First phase, with its proximity to overall peak and short duration, could be interpreted as a “peak” phase. Second phase, affected largely by parity, could be interpreted as a “persistency” phase.},

This will provide information on early lactation and shorten generation interval. Major purpose of this study was to determine persistency within and between lactations of Turkish Saanen goats in morning, evening and daily milk yields. Two different methods were employed. One used ratios of the succeeding test days as dependent variables. The multivariate analyses indicated that effects of parity (P=0.05), year (P 2, ln(DIM) and [ln(DIM)]2 on morning and evening values and total daily milk weights were analyzed to characterize the lactation curve. Values of DIM and repeated measure id number of the goats were added to the model within parity. Within lactation correlations were estimated as 0.22 for morning, 0.28 for evening and 0.27 for daily milk yield. Evening milk tests can alone be used to estimate lactation milk yield, instead of the total test day milk yield. Milk yield increased until lactation four, and decreased in lactation five in morning, evening and daily milk yields. There was a sharp increase from first lactation to second (ranged from 22.0 to 26.8\%) and second lactation to third (ranged from 20.0 to 22.2\%).},

	abstract = {The decline in milk yield after peak lactation in dairy animals has long been a biological conundrum for the mammary biologist, as well as a cause of considerable lost income for the dairy farmer. Recent advances in understanding the control of the mammary cell population now offer new insights on the former, and a potential means of alleviating the latter. The weight of evidence now indicates that a change in mammary cell number, the result of an imbalance between cell proliferation and cell removal, is a principal cause of declining production. Further, it suggests that the persistency of lactation, the rate of decline in milk yield with stage of lactation, is strongly influenced by the rate of cell death by apoptosis in the lactating gland. Mammary apoptosis was first demonstrated during tissue involution after lactation, but has now been detected during lactation, in mammary tissue of lactating mice, goats and cattle. Those factors that determine the rate of cell death by apoptosis are as yet poorly characterized, but include the frequency of milking in lactating goats. Initial evidence suggests that nutrition also is likely to influence cell survival after peak lactation, an important factor being the degree of oxidative stress imposed by feed and the tissue's ability to deal with, and prevent damage by, reactive oxygen species. Comparison of cows in calf or not pregnant during declining lactation also indicates a likely influence of reproductive hormones, with oestradiol and progesterone acting to preserve mammary ductal and alveolar integrity during the dry period, while allowing a degree of apoptosis and cell replacement. In each case, the molecular mechanisms controlling mammary cell survival (or otherwise) are as yet poorly defined. On the other hand, more persistent lactations are likely to benefit animal welfare through fewer calvings and by placing less emphasis on maximal production at peak lactation, and modelling of persistent lactation with longer calving intervals indicates their likely economic benefits. In these circumstances, there is considerable incentive to elucidate the determinants of mammary apoptosis, and the factors controlling the dynamic balance between cell proliferation and cell death in the lactating mammary gland.},

The objective of this study was to typologize the lactation curves in French dairy goats and analyze the influence of environmental and genetic factors on these curves. The data set consisted of 2,231,720 monthly test-day records of 213,534 French Saanen and Alpine goats recorded between September 2008 and June 2012. First, principal component analysis classified the shape of the lactation curves into 3 principal components: the first component accounted for milk yield level throughout lactation, the second component accounted for lactation persistency, and the third component accounted for milk yield in mid-lactation. Then, from the principal component scores, the lactations were clustered into 5 different groups. Most lactations had a similar shape to the mean curve, except 30\% of the lactations that fell into 3 clusters that had a high production level at the peak and then a different persistency according to cluster. Estimated breeding value for milk yield and home region of breeding were the factors most related to lactation production level. Month of kidding, breed, and gestation stage had the biggest effect on persistency. Month of kidding was the factor most strongly linked to mid-lactation production. A herd effect was observed on all 3 principal components.},

	abstract = {Until recently, the main selection focus in UK dairy goats has been on milk yield. To develop a selection index suitably weighted for a variety of traits, it is important to understand the genetic relationships between production, health and fertility traits. This study focussed on three aspects of reproduction that are of interest to goat breeders. (1) Out of season (OOS) kidding ability: goats are highly seasonal breeders so achieving consistent, year-round dairy production presents a challenge. It may be possible to select for extended or shifted breeding cycles, however, there are no published studies on the genetic basis of seasonal kidding ability, and a genetic correlation with milk production in dairy goats; (2) age at first kidding (AFK): a reduced AFK offers the opportunity for more rapid genetic improvement, as well as reducing the amount of time and resources required to raise the animals to producing age; (3) pseudopregnancy (PPG): as it is difficult to diagnose pregnancy within 30 days of mating, high herd levels of PPG could add a significant delay in breeding replacement animals, or commencing a new lactation. Using records from 9546 goats, the objective of this study was to investigate the genetic relationships between the reproductive traits described above, and the production traits 520-day milk yield (MY520), lifetime milk yield (MYLife) and lifetime number of days in milk (DIMLife). The 'out of season' phenotype was defined as week of kidding relative to the 4 weeks of the year where the highest average number of births occur. Incidences of PPG that occurred during the first lactation were used as cases, while goats with none were assigned as controls. Relevant fixed and random effects were fitted in the models. In line with other reproduction traits, heritability estimates were low ranging from 0.08 to 0.11. A negative genetic correlation was found between AFK and MY520 (-0.22±0.10), whereas a positive genetic correlation was found between PPG and DIMLife (0.58±0.11). Pseudopregnancy and OOS were positively genetically correlated (0.36±0.15). All other genetic correlations were very low. The results of this study indicate that selection for the reproductive traits analysed is feasible, without adversely affecting MYLife.},

	abstract = {As part of the development of a breeding programme for dairy goats to support sustainable production in organic farming, the overall aim of the present study was to identify traits that can be used as selection criteria for lifetime productivity. The breeding goal is high lifetime productivity with a good milk composition and a good level of robustness in the animals, especially within grazing systems. The lifetime productivity traits analysed in this study were the length of the animal's productive life (LPL), the lifetime efficiency (LEF), and the animal's milk yield efficiency with respect the total number of lactating days (EDM); the average fat and protein content over the animal's lifetime, the fat-to-protein ratio (FPR), and the urea content (UC) were also included as indirect health traits and potential indicators of robustness in dairy goats. The traits' influencing factors, phenotypic and genetic correlations, and heritability were examined. Furthermore, factors influencing milk yield in the first 120 d of lactation during the animal's first lactation were analysed. The aim of investigating milk yield during the first lactation was to consider a connection between early performance recoding in the life of an animal and LPL, LEF, and EDM. In total, lactation and pedigree data from 9192 dairy goats of the common German Fawn (GF) and German White (GW) dairy breeds were used. Prerequisites were that the investigated birth cohorts had to have definitively completed their lifetime production, and a high proportion of goats had to have completed extended lactation. The data analysis showed that breed did not influence milk yield. The age at first kidding, the average number of kids born during the animal's lifetime, and the lactation length did influence the milk yield. This applies to the milk yield during the first 120 d of the first lactation as well as over the lifetime of an animal. Considering the influencing factors, the results showed that LPL was genetically and positively correlated with LEF and EDM (  r g = 0.65 ± 0.06  and 0.29 ± 0.07  respectively). The heritability of LPL, LEF, and EDM was 0.22 ± 0.02  , 0.29 ± 0.03  , and 0.44 ± 0.03  respectively. Regarding the lifetime milk composition, the heritability of protein and fat content, FPR, and UC was 0.63 ± 0.02  , 0.52 ± 0.02  , 0.32 ± 0.03  , and 0.47 ± 0.04  respectively. The heritability regarding the milk yield during the first 120 d of the first lactation was 0.34 ± 0.03  . We found that the milk yield during the first 120 d of the first lactation showed a genetic correlation with LPL, LEF, and EDM of 0.30 ± 0.08  , 0.82 ± 0.04  , and 0.89 ± 0.03  respectively. In summary, LPL, LEF, and EDM are suitable traits to indicate lifetime productivity in dairy goats. An additional indicator for lifetime productivity could be the milk yield during the first 120 d of the first lactation. Moreover, FPR and UC appear to be promising indicator traits for the health and robustness of dairy goats. The present study showed the importance of considering extended lactation in selective breeding programmes as well as the importance of modelling extended lactation in the breeding value estimation.},

We implemented a random regression model for the genetic evaluation of lactation curve shapes of dairy traits in French Alpine goats for their first 3 parities.

The data consisted of test-day records from 49,849 first lactation Alpine goats during their first 3 lactations. The reference model used a Legendre polynomial of order 2 for each parity to describe the genetic and permanent environmental effects, and was compared with a model that combined the second and third parities. A rank reduction of the variance-covariance matrix was also performed using an eigenvalue decomposition for each parity from the 2 models. Genetic parameters were consistent between the models tested. With a reduction to rank 2 and combining the second and third parities, the first 2 principal components correctly summarized the genetic variability of milk yield level and persistency, with a near-nil correlation between the 2, and with a much shorter computation time than the reference model. A favorable correlation of +0.43 between milk yield persistency and fat/protein ratio persistency at the beginning of the lactation was found from buck estimated breeding values.},

	abstract = {Currently, breeding values for dairy goats in the United Kingdom are not estimated and selection is based only on phenotypes. Several studies from other countries have applied various methodologies to estimate breeding values for milk yield in dairy goats. However, most of the previous analyses were based on relatively small data sets, which might have affected the accuracy of the parameter estimates. The objective of this study was to estimate genetic parameters for milk yield in crossbred dairy goats in lactations 1 to 4. The research was based on data provided by 2 commercial goat farms in the United Kingdom comprising 390,482 milk yield records on 13,591 dairy goats kidding between 1987 and 2012. The population was created by crossing 3 breeds: Alpine, Saanen, and Toggenburg. In each generation, the best-performing animals were selected for breeding and, as a result, a synthetic breed was created. The pedigree file contained 28,184 individuals, of which 2,414 were founders. The data set contained test-day records of milk yield, lactation number, farm, age at kidding, and year and season of kidding. Data on milk composition was unavailable. Covariance components were estimated with the average information REML algorithm in the ASReml package (VSN International Ltd., Hemel Hempstead, UK). A random regression animal model for milk yield with fixed effects of herd test day, year-season, and age at kidding was used. Heritability was the highest at 200 and 250d in milk (DIM), reaching 0.45 in the first lactation and between 0.34 and 0.25 in subsequent lactations. After 300 DIM, the heritability started decreasing to 0.23 and 0.10 at 400 DIM in the first and subsequent lactations, respectively. Genetic correlation between milk yield in the first and subsequent lactations was between 0.16 and 0.88. This study found that milk yields in first and subsequent lactations are highly correlated, both at the genetic and phenotypic level. Estimates of heritability for milk yield were higher than most of the values reported in the literature, although they were in the range reported in this species. This should facilitate genetic improvement for the population studied as part of a broader multi-trait breeding program.},

The objective of this study was to estimate genetic parameters for milk yield based on a test day model. For the analysis 35,308, 30,551 and 23,640 test day records from lactations 1, 2 and 3 from 5079, 4118 and 3132 animals, respectively, were used. The data between 1987 and 2003 were obtained from six German breeding societies. The multiple trait (lactations 1, 2 and 3) repeatability model (RPT) included the fixed effects of breeding society-breed-herd-year, litter size, lambing season, and days in milk of third-order Legendre polynomials nested within herd-year, and the random effects of animal additive and permanent environment. The three-trait random regression model (RR) also included the random regressions based on second-order Legendre polynomials for animal additive and permanent environmental effects. Heritability estimates in RPT were 0.27 +/- 0.02, 0.20 +/- 0.02 and 0.37 +/- 0.02 for the first, second and third lactation, respectively. The genetic correlation between the first and second lactation was 0.69, between the second and third lactation 0.79, and between the first and third lactation 0.45. Heritability estimates from the RR in the first and second lactations decreased from the beginning to the end of the lactation, with average values of 0.28 and 0.27, respectively. Estimates in the third lactation showed a maximum in the middle of lactation, averaging 0.37. Genetic correlations between the first and second lactation averaged 0.64, between the second and third lactation 0.72, and between the first and third lactation 0.46. Despite the small data set and restricted relationship structure the estimates were reasonable with the exception of estimates from the third lactation, which seemed inflated.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Random regression models (RRM) are widely used to analyze longitudinal data in genetic evaluation systems because they can better account for time-course changes in environmental effects and additive genetic values of animals by fitting the test-day (TD) specific effects. Our objective was to implement a random regression model for the evaluation of dairy production traits in French goats.
RESULTS: The data consisted of milk TD records from 30,186 and 32,256 first lactations of Saanen and Alpine goats. Milk yield, fat yield, protein yield, fat content and protein content were considered. Splines were used to model the environmental factors. The genetic and permanent environmental effects were modeled by the same Legendre polynomials. The goodness-of-fit and the genetic parameters derived from functions of the polynomials of orders 0 to 4 were tested. Results were also compared to those from a lactation model with total milk yield calculated over 250 days and to those of a multiple-trait model that considers performance in six periods throughout lactation as different traits. Genetic parameters were consistent between models. Models with fourth-order Legendre polynomials led to the best fit of the data. In order to reduce complexity, computing time, and interpretation, a rank reduction of the variance covariance matrix was performed using eigenvalue decomposition. With a reduction to rank 2, the first two principal components correctly summarized the genetic variability of milk yield level and persistency, with a correlation close to 0 between them.
CONCLUSIONS: A random regression model was implemented in France to evaluate and select goats for yield traits and persistency, which are independent i.e. no genetic correlation between them, in first lactation.},

	abstract = {Reproductive seasonality observed in all breeds of goats originating from temperate latitudes and in some breeds from subtropical latitudes can now be controlled by artificial changes in photoperiod. Short days stimulate sexual activity, while long days inhibit it. This knowledge has allowed the development of photoperiodic treatments to control sexual activity in goats, for both the buck and doe. In the French intensive milk production system, goat AI plays an important role to control reproduction and, in conjunction with progeny testing, to improve milk production. Most dairy goats are inseminated out of the breeding season with deep frozen semen, after induction of oestrus and ovulation by hormonal treatments. This protocol provides a kidding rate of approximately 65\%. New breeding strategies have been developed, based on the buck effect associated with AI, to reduce the use of hormones. With the development of insemination with frozen semen, a classical selection programme was set up, including planned mating, progeny testing and the diffusion of proved sires by inseminations in herds. Functional traits have become important for efficient breeding schemes in the dairy goat industries. Based on knowledge gained over the past decade, the emphasis in selective breeding has been placed on functional traits related to udder morphology and health. New windows have been opened based on new molecular tools, allowing the detection and mapping of genes of economic importance.},

	abstract = {Thirty multiparous Murciano-Granadina dairy goats milked once daily were used to study the lactational effects of an extended 24-mo kidding interval (K24; n = 14) compared with the traditional 12-mo kidding interval (K12; n = 16). Goats were divided into 2 groups at wk 29 of lactation balanced with respect to parity, milk yield, and somatic cell count. Over a period of 92 wk, K12 goats were mated twice, at wk 29 during the first lactation and at wk 79 during the second lactation, whereas K24 goats were mated once, at wk 79 of extended first lactation. The K12 goats were dried off from wk 14 to 21 of pregnancy (wk 43 to 50 of lactation). Milk yield was recorded from wk 2 to 92, and milk composition was studied from wk 29 to 92. Milk fatty acids were analyzed in milk samples taken at wk 39 (wk 10 of pregnancy) and 55 (wk 5 of subsequent lactation), when milk in udder compartments (cisternal and alveolar) was also evaluated. Average milk yield during the first 29 wk was 2.23 +/- 0.13 L/d. Pregnancy reduced milk yield in K12 goats from wk 39 to 42 of lactation compared with K24 goats. During the dry period for K12 goats, milk yield of K24 goats averaged 1.53 +/- 0.10 L/d. From wk 51 to 79, K12 goats produced 32\% more milk than did K24 goats, but their milk contained lower fat and protein than that of K24 goats. No changes were detected for milk lactose and somatic cell count from wk 51 to 79. From wk 80 to 92, differences in milk yield and milk composition between groups were not significant. Milk of pregnant K12 goats contained higher C16:1 and conjugated C18:2 fatty acids, and had a higher desaturase index than milk of open K24 goats at wk 39. In the following lactation (wk 55), milk of K12 goats contained higher C18:2 and C18:3, and lower C16:0 fatty acids, resulting in a lower atherogenicity index compared with K24 goats. Cisternal milk at wk 39 was lower for K12 than K24 goats, whereas alveolar milk did not differ. In K12 goats, values of cisternal milk tripled, but alveolar milk only doubled at wk 55 (wk 5 of subsequent lactation) compared with wk 39, indicating the importance of the cistern in accommodating high milk yield in early lactation. Values of cisternal and alveolar milk did not differ between wk 39 and 55 for K24 goats. Fat content was higher for alveolar milk than cisternal milk for K12 goats at wk 55 and for K24 goats at wk 39 and 55. No differences in milk protein or lactose were detected between cisternal and alveolar milk. In conclusion, pregnancy reduced milk yield from wk 10 after conceiving onwards. Extended lactation did not significantly decrease milk yield (-8.2\%), but increased milk components that may contribute to cheese yield, and may be a useful strategy for reducing metabolic stress in early lactation and for simplifying herd management in dairy goats.},

	abstract = {The importance of small ruminants to the dairy industry has increased in recent years, especially in developing countries, where it has a high economic and social impact. Interestingly and despite the fact that the mammary gland is the specialised milk production organ, very few authors studied the modifications occurring in the mammary gland through the lactation period in production animals, particularly in the small ruminants, sheep (Ovis aries) and goat (Capra hircus). Nevertheless, understanding the different mammary gland patterns throughout lactation is essential to improve dairy production. In addition, associating these patterns with different milking frequencies, lactation number or different diets is also of high importance, directly affecting the dairy industry. The mammary gland is commonly composed of parenchyma and stroma, which includes the ductal system, with individual proportions of each changing during the different periods and yields in a lactation cycle. Indeed, during late gestation, as well as during early to mid-lactation, mammary gland expansion occurs, with an increase in the number of epithelial cells and lumen area, which leads to increment of the parenchyma tissue, as well as a reduction of stroma, corresponding macroscopically to the increase in mammary gland volume. Throughout late lactation, the mammary gland volume decreases owing to the regression of the secretory structure. In general, common mammary gland patterns have been shown for both goats and sheep throughout the several lactation stages, although the number of studies is limited. The main objective of this manuscript is to review the colostrogenesis and lactogenesis processes as well as to highlight the mammary gland morphological patterns underlying milk production during the lactation cycle for small ruminants, and to describe potential differences between goats and sheep, hence contributing to a better description of mammary gland development during lactation for these two poorly studied species.},

The objective of this study was to typologize the lactation curves in French dairy goats and analyze the influence of environmental and genetic factors on these curves. The data set consisted of 2,231,720 monthly test-day records of 213,534 French Saanen and Alpine goats recorded between September 2008 and June 2012. First, principal component analysis classified the shape of the lactation curves into 3 principal components: the first component accounted for milk yield level throughout lactation, the second component accounted for lactation persistency, and the third component accounted for milk yield in mid-lactation. Then, from the principal component scores, the lactations were clustered into 5 different groups. Most lactations had a similar shape to the mean curve, except 30\% of the lactations that fell into 3 clusters that had a high production level at the peak and then a different persistency according to cluster. Estimated breeding value for milk yield and home region of breeding were the factors most related to lactation production level. Month of kidding, breed, and gestation stage had the biggest effect on persistency. Month of kidding was the factor most strongly linked to mid-lactation production. A herd effect was observed on all 3 principal components.},

Breed affects scale of the curve; parity affects scale and shape; season of kidding mainly affects shape (persistency); and level of production affects scale and shape (persistency).

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to assess the cradle-to-farm gate carbon footprint of indoor and outdoor dairy goat farming systems in New Zealand, identifying hotspots and discussing variability and methodology. Our study was based on the International Organization for Standardization standards for life cycle assessment, although only results for greenhouse gas emissions are presented. Two functional units were included: tonnes of CO2-equivalents (CO2e) per hectare (ha) and kilograms of CO2e per kilogram of fat- and protein-corrected milk (FPCM). The study covered 5 farms, 2 farming systems, and 3yr. Two methods for the calculation of enteric methane emissions were assessed. The Lassey method, as used in the New Zealand greenhouse gas inventory, provided a more robust estimate of emissions from enteric fermentation and was used in the final calculations. The alternative dry matter intake method was shown to overestimate emissions due to use of anecdotal assumptions around actual consumption of feed. Economic allocation was applied to milk and co-products. Scenario analysis was performed on the allocation method, nitrogen content of manure, manure management, and supplementary feed choice. The average carbon footprint for the indoor farms (n=3) was 11.05 t of CO2e/ha and 0.81kg of CO2e/kg of FPCM. For the outdoor farms (n=2), the average was 5.38 t of CO2e/ha and 1.03kg of CO2e/kg of FPCM. The average for all 5 farms was 8.78 t of CO2e/ha and 0.90kg of CO2e/kg of FPCM. The results showed relatively high variability due to differences in management practices between farms. The 5 farms covered 10\% of the total dairy goat farms but may not be representative of an average farm. Methane from enteric fermentation was a major emission source. The use of supplementary feed was highly variable but an important contributor to the carbon footprint. Nitrous oxide can contribute up to 18\% of emissions. Indoor goat farming systems produced milk with a significantly higher carbon footprint per area of land farmed compared with outdoor farming systems, although the 2 systems were not significantly different when results were expressed per kilogram of FPCM, at 0.81kg CO2e and 1.03kg CO2e per kg of FPCM, respectively. Both systems had footprints less than other reported dairy goat carbon footprints and on par with those for New Zealand dairy cows. The methodology used to determine enteric methane is important for an accurate and meaningful assessment. The choice of manure management system and supplementary feed can substantially affect the carbon footprint.},

	abstract = {Although numbers are still low compared to cattle rearing, intensive dairy goat farms have been widely spreading in the Italian livestock systems. Since goats are quite rustic, they can easily adapt to different management practices; however, improving the efficiency can make the difference, both in productivity and on the environmental impact attributed to goat milk production. In the present study, the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach was used to quantify the potential environmental impact of goat milk production system in 17 farms in Lombardy (Northern Italy). Together with the environmental assessment, statistical analysis was carried out in order to determine whether it was possible to identify any relation among the variables that characterise this farming system. From an environmental point of view, it has been shown that the lower the individual milk production, the more it affects the environmental impact: specifically, the carbon footprint appears higher than the one emitted by cattle milk production. Climate Change resulted, on average, equal to 2.67 kg CO2 eq/kg Fat and Protein Corrected Milk (FPCM) with a wide variability (min: 1.12 kg CO2 eq/kg FPCM; max: 5.05 kg CO2 eq/kg FPCM). Purchased feed was the main hotspot for several environmental impact categories (such as freshwater eutrophication, land use and mineral, fossil and renewable resources depletion). Enteric emissions and emissions from manure storage were hotspots for climate change, particulate matter and terrestrial acidification. The C sequestration during crop cultivation was not considered. As shown by the statistical analysis, the main driver which influenced the 6 main impact categories was, in fact, individual milk production. The environmental assessment was also performed considering a second Functional Unit (FU) (i.e. 1 ha of land) and the statistical analysis conducted on this FU showed the relevance of livestock intensity. In addition to this, the statistical analysis also showed how a restricted land availability can negatively affect the environmental outcome. This study represents one of the first studies on the environmental impact assessment of dairy goat milk production. Additionally, studying two FUs and using a statistical analysis approach helped to identify the main management options to which farmers should pay attention to improve goat milk production from an environmental point of view.},

	abstract = {Differences between production systems based on grazing and browsing vs. use of harvested feedstuffs in confinement largely depend on specific feedstuffs and plants available and being consumed. Low forage nutrient ingestion should have relatively greater impact on tissue mobilization than milk production in early than later periods of lactation, with a transition to proportionally greater change in milk production in late lactation. However, low body condition at kidding would limit tissue energy mobilization and restrict impact of level of nutrient intake to milk yield and, likewise, tissue mobilization would be less with one vs. two or three milkings per day. As lactation advances after freshening, fat and protein levels decrease with increasing milk yield, and when production declines in mid- to late lactation, fat and protein concentrations increase. Milk production generally peaks at a parity of 3 or 4, thereafter declining slowly. Elevated somatic cell count alone in dairy goats is not a valid indication of mammary infection. Extended lactations offer opportunities to minimize or avoid seasonal fluctuations in milk production and lessen production costs. If differences in performance between suckled and machine-milked dairy goats occur, they may be restricted to or of greater magnitude during the suckling period compared with post-weaning, and differences in milk yield will either be absent or less with one kid compared with greater litter sizes. The magnitude of effects of milking frequency on milk yield is less for goats of low vs. high production potential and with low vs. high diet quality. Likewise, the effect of milking frequency is greater in early and mid-lactation when yield is higher than in late lactation, along with a shorter period of peak production with one vs. two daily milkings. Physical form of the diet can affect production and composition of goat milk, although effects appear of smaller magnitude than in dairy cattle. When tissue is mobilized to support milk production in early lactation, levels of C18:0 and C18:1 cis in milk increase and levels of medium-chain fatty acids decline. Effects of elevated levels of dietary fatty acids on specific long-chain fatty acids in milk and milk products vary with the fatty acid profile of fat sources used.},

	abstract = {The study was conducted with the objective of estimating genetic and phenotypic parameters for tick (CRM) and Babesia bigemina (IBBi), Babesia bovis (IBBo), and Anaplasma marginale (IAM) burden in Angus female breed in Brazil. The sample group was composed of Angus females raised in herds located in a region of endemic instability for cattle tick fever in the state of Rio Grande Sul (RS), Brazil. The variance components were estimated using Bayesian inference and Gibbs sampling algorithm, considering a multi-trait animal model. Heritability estimates showed values of low magnitude, ranging from 0.03 (IBBo) to 0.16 (CRM), while repeatability estimates ranged between 0.07 (IBBo) and 0.21 (CRM). Regarding the genetic correlation estimates, the values showed low (−0.01 for IBBo × IAM) to moderate (0.55 between IBBi × IAM) magnitudes. The results indicate that it is possible to use tick count and hemoparasite infection levels as selection criteria, with small genetic gains.},

	abstract = {Genetic selection has been a very successful tool for the long-term improvement of livestock populations, and the rapid adoption of genomic selection over the last decade has doubled the rate of gain in some populations. Breeding programs seek to identify genetically superior parents of the next generation, typically as a function of an index that combines information about many economically important traits into a single number. In the United States, the data that drive this system are collected through the national dairy herd improvement program that began more than a century ago. The resulting information about animal performance, pedigree, and genotype is used to compute genomic evaluations for comparing and ranking animals for selection. However, the full expression of genetic potential requires that animals are placed in environments that can support such performance. The Agricultural Research Service of the US Department of Agriculture and the Council on Dairy Cattle Breeding collaborate to deliver state-of-the-art genomic evaluations to the dairy industry. Today, most breeding stock are selected and marketed using the net merit dollars (NM\$) selection index, which evolved from 2 traits in 1926 (milk and fat yield) to a combination of 36 individual traits following the last NM\$ update in 2018. Updates to NM\$ require the estimation of many different values, and it can be difficult to achieve consensus from stakeholders on what should be added to, or removed from, the index at each review, and how those traits should be weighted. Over time, the majority of the emphasis in the index has shifted from yield traits to fertility, health, and fitness traits. Phenotypes for some of these new traits are difficult or expensive to measure, or require changes to on-farm habits that have not been widely adopted. This is driving interest in sensor-based systems that provide continuous measurements of the farm environment, individual animal performance, and detailed milk composition. There is also a need to capture more detailed data about the environment in which animals perform, including information about feeding, housing, milking systems, and infectious and parasitic load. However, many challenges accompany these new technologies, including a lack of standardization or validation, need for high-speed internet connections, increased computational requirements, and interpretations that are often not backed by direct observations of biological phenomena. This work will describe how US selection objectives are developed, as well as discuss opportunities and challenges associated with new technologies for measuring and recording animal performance.},

	abstract = {Genetic selection could be a tool to help improve the health and welfare of calves, however, to date, there is limited research on the genetics of calfhood diseases. This study aimed to understand the current impact of calf diseases, by investigating incidence rates, estimating genetic parameters, and providing industry recommendations to improve calf disease recording practices on farms. Available calf disease data comprised of 69,695 Holstein calf disease records for respiratory problems (RESP) and diarrhea (DIAR), from 62,361 calves collected on 1,617 Canadian dairy herds from 2006 to 2021. Single and multiple trait analysis using both a threshold and linear animal model for each trait were evaluated. Furthermore, each trait was analyzed using 2 scenarios with respect to minimum disease incidence threshold criterion (herd-year incidence of at least 1\% and 5\%) to highlight the impact of different filtering thresholds on selection potential. Observed scale heritability estimates for RESP and DIAR ranged from 0.02 to 0.07 across analyses, while estimated genetic correlations between the traits ranged from 0.50 to 0.62. Sires were compared based on their estimated breeding value and their diseased daughter incidence rates. On average, calves born to the bottom 10\% of sires were 1.8 times more likely to develop RESP and 1.9 times to develop DIAR compared with daughters born to the top 10\% of sires. Results from the current study are promising for the inclusion of both DIAR and RESP in Canadian genetic evaluations. However, for effective genetic evaluation we require standardized approaches on data collection and industry outreach to highlight the importance of collecting and uploading this information to herd management software. In particular, it is important that the herd management software is accessible to the national milk recording system to allow for use in national genetic evaluation.},

Our analysis of 17 million sequence variants in 44,000+ Australian dairy cattle for 34 traits suggests, on average, one pleiotropic QTL existing in each 50 kb chromosome-segment. We selected a set of 80k variants representing potentially causal variants within each chromosome segment to develop a bovine XT-50K genotyping array. The custom array contains many pleiotropic variants with biological functions, including splicing QTLs and variants at conserved sites across 100 vertebrate species. This biology-informed custom array outperformed the standard array in predicting genetic value of multiple traits across populations in independent datasets of 90,000+ dairy cattle from the USA, Australia and New Zealand.},

	abstract = {Feed efficiency has become an increasingly important research topic in recent years. As feed costs rise and the environmental impacts of agriculture become more apparent, improving the efficiency with which dairy cows convert feed to milk is increasingly important. However, feed intake is expensive to measure accurately on large populations, making the inclusion of this trait in breeding programs difficult. Understanding how the genetic parameters of feed efficiency and traits related to feed efficiency vary throughout the lactation period is valuable to gain understanding into the genetic nature of feed efficiency. This study used 121,226 dry matter intake (DMI) records, 120,500 energy corrected milk (ECM) records, and 98,975 metabolic body weight (MBW) records, collected on 7,440 first lactation Holstein cows from 6 countries (Canada, Denmark, Germany, Spain, Switzerland, and United States of America), from January 2003 to February 2022. Genetic parameters were estimated using a multiple-trait random regression model with a fourth order Legendre polynomial for all traits. Weekly phenotypes for DMI were re-parameterized using linear regressions of DMI on ECM and MBW, creating a measure of feed efficiency that was genetically corrected for ECM and MBW, referred to as genomic residual feed intake (gRFI). Heritability (SE) estimates varied from 0.15 (0.03) to 0.29 (0.02) for DMI, 0.24 (0.01) to 0.29 (0.03) for ECM, 0.55 (0.03) to 0.83 (0.05) for MBW, and 0.12 (0.03) to 0.22 (0.06) for gRFI. In general, heritability estimates were lower in the first stage of lactation compared with the later stages of lactation. Additive genetic correlations between weeks of lactation varied, with stronger correlations between weeks of lactation that were close together. The results of this study contribute to a better understanding of the change in genetic parameters across the first lactation, providing insight into potential selection strategies to include feed efficiency in breeding programs.},

A total of 778 records of entry scores, chute scores, exit scores, flight speed, cortisol, glucose, lactate, live weight, and body condition scores were collected on steers and heifers of the three breeds, born between September and December. The animals came from the Advanced Beef Cattle Research Center of the Animal Science Institute. The variance analyses were performed using the GENMOD procedure. The PROC CORR estimated Spearman correlation coefficients for all traits studied, and the principal components analysis was performed according to the procedure PRINCOMP. Heifers had higher reactivity than steers, with higher behavioral scores and blood parameters. Overall, Caracu individuals demonstrated lower reactivity in comparison to Nelore and Guzerá. However, they presented high stress when they were restrained. The principal component analysis highlighted that behavioral traits and blood parameters were contrasted with growth traits; thus, this analysis can help selectors (livestock farmers) to understand the importance of selecting less reactive animals and more easily choose the animals they want to selected for breeding. Our results indicate that handling in corrals could be considered a stressful event for bovines. For this reason, measuring blood parameters and behavioral traits can compose necessary decision-making tools regarding changes and adequacies while handling events to reduce stress and consequently improve the herd’s reactivity.},

	abstract = {Single-step genomic evaluation became a standard procedure in livestock breeding, and the main reason is the ability to combine all pedigree, phenotypes, and genotypes available into one single evaluation, without the need of post-analysis processing. Therefore, the incorporation of data on genotyped and non-genotyped animals in this method is straightforward. Since 2009, two main implementations of single-step were proposed. One is called single-step genomic best linear unbiased prediction (ssGBLUP) and uses single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) to construct the genomic relationship matrix; the other is the single-step Bayesian regression (ssBR), which is a marker effect model. Under the same assumptions, both models are equivalent. In this review, we focus solely on ssGBLUP. The implementation of ssGBLUP into the BLUPF90 software suite was done in 2009, and since then, several changes were made to make ssGBLUP flexible to any model, number of traits, number of phenotypes, and number of genotyped animals. Single-step GBLUP from the BLUPF90 software suite has been used for genomic evaluations worldwide. In this review, we will show theoretical developments and numerical examples of ssGBLUP using SNP data from regular chips to sequence data.},

	abstract = {Genomic evaluations are routine in most plant and livestock breeding programs but are used infrequently in dairy goat breeding schemes. In this context, the purpose of this study was to investigate the use of the single-step genomic BLUP method for predicting genomic breeding values for milk production traits (milk, protein, and fat yields; protein and fat percentages) in Canadian Alpine and Saanen dairy goats. There were 6,409 and 12,236 Alpine records and 3,434 and 5,008 Saanen records for each trait in first and later lactations, respectively, and a total of 1,707 genotyped animals (833 Alpine and 874 Saanen). Two validation approaches were used, forward validation (i.e., animals born after 2013 with an average estimated breeding value accuracy from the full data set ≥0.50) and forward cross-validation (i.e., subsets of all animals included in the forward validation were used in successive replications). The forward cross-validation approach resulted in similar validation accuracies (0.55 to 0.66 versus 0.54 to 0.61) and biases (−0.01 to –0.07 versus −0.03 to 0.11) to the forward validation when averaged across traits. Additionally, both single and multiple-breed analyses were compared, and similar average accuracies and biases were observed across traits. However, there was a small gain in accuracy from the use of multiple-breed models for the Saanen breed. A small gain in validation accuracy for genomically enhanced estimated breeding values (GEBV) relative to pedigree-based estimated breeding values (EBV) was observed across traits for the Alpine breed, but not for the Saanen breed, possibly due to limitations in the validation design, heritability of the traits evaluated, and size of the training populations. Trait-specific gains in theoretical accuracy of GEBV relative to EBV for the validation animals ranged from 17 to 31\% in Alpine and 35 to 55\% in Saanen, using the cross-validation approach. The GEBV predicted from the full data set were 12 to 16\% more accurate than EBV for genotyped animals, but no gains were observed for nongenotyped animals. The largest gains were found for does without lactation records (35–41\%) and bucks without daughter records (46–54\%), and consequently, the implementation of genomic selection in the Canadian dairy goat population would be expected to increase selection accuracy for young breeding candidates. Overall, this study represents the first step toward implementation of genomic selection in Canadian dairy goat populations.},

The findings of empirical field studies applying GS to the breeding sectors of these main animal protein industries are reviewed. Several translational considerations must be addressed before implementing GS in genetic improvement programs. These include determining and obtaining economically relevant phenotypes and determining the optimal size of the training population, cost-effective genotyping strategies, the practicality of field implementation, and the relative costs versus the benefits of the realized rate of genetic gain. GS may additionally change the optimal breeding scheme design, and studies that address this consideration are also reviewed briefly.},

	abstract = {Estimated breeding values (EBVs) using data from genetic markers can be predicted using a genomic relationship matrix, derived from animal’s genotypes, and best linear unbiased prediction. However, if the accuracy of the EBVs is calculated in the usual manner (from the inverse element of the coefficient matrix), it is likely to be overestimated owing to sampling errors in elements of the genomic relationship matrix. We show here that the correct accuracy can be obtained by regressing the relationship matrix towards the pedigree relationship matrix so that it is an unbiased estimate of the relationships at the QTL controlling the trait. This method shows how the accuracy increases as the number of markers used increases because the regression coefficient (of genomic relationship towards pedigree relationship) increases. We also present a deterministic method for predicting the accuracy of such genomic EBVs before data on individual animals are collected. This method estimates the proportion of genetic variance explained by the markers, which is equal to the regression coefficient described above, and the accuracy with which marker effects are estimated. The latter depends on the variance in relationship between pairs of animals, which equals the mean linkage disequilibrium over all pairs of loci. The theory was validated using simulated data and data on fat concentration in the milk of Holstein cattle.},

Based on this, an extension of the genomic relationship matrix can be constructed in which genomic relationships are propagated to all individuals, resulting in a combined relationship matrix, which can be used in a BLUP procedure called the Single Step Genomic BLUP. This procedure provides so far the most comprehensive option for genomic evaluation.

This requires a two-step procedure where pseudo-data (for instance, daughter yield deviations) are computed from full records and pedigree data and later used for genomic evaluation. This results in bias and loss of information. One way to incorporate the genomic information into a full genetic evaluation is by modifying the numerator relationship matrix. A naive proposal is to substitute the relationships of genotyped animals with the genomic relationship matrix. However, this results in incoherencies because the genomic relationship matrix includes information on relationships among ancestors and descendants. In other words, using the pedigree-derived covariance between genotyped and ungenotyped individuals, with the pretense that genomic information does not exist, leads to inconsistencies. It is proposed to condition the genetic value of ungenotyped animals on the genetic value of genotyped animals via the selection index (e.g., pedigree information), and then use the genomic relationship matrix for the latter. This results in a joint distribution of genotyped and ungenotyped genetic values, with a pedigree-genomic relationship matrix H. In this matrix, genomic information is transmitted to the covariances among all ungenotyped individuals. The matrix is (semi)positive definite by construction, which is not the case for the naive approach. Numerical examples and alternative expressions are discussed. Matrix H is suitable for iteration on data algorithms that multiply a vector times a matrix, such as preconditioned conjugated gradients.},

For each contiguous pair of SNPs there are four possible haplotypes that could be inherited from the sire. The effects of each interval on a trait can be estimated for all intervals simultaneously in a model where interval effects are random factors. Given the estimated effects of each haplotype for every interval in the genome, and given an animal's genotype, a ‘genomic’ estimated breeding value is obtained by summing the estimated effects for that genotype. The accuracy of that estimator of breeding values is around 80\%. Because the genomic estimated breeding values can be calculated at birth, and because it has a high accuracy, a strategy that utilizes these advantages was compared with a traditional progeny testing strategy under a typical Canadian-like dairy cattle situation. Costs of proving bulls were reduced by 92\% and genetic change was increased by a factor of 2. Genome-wide selection may become a popular tool for genetic improvement in livestock.},

The research was based on data provided by 2 commercial goat farms in the UK comprising 590,409 milk yield records on 14,453 dairy goats kidding between 1987 and 2013. The population was created by crossing 3 breeds: Alpine, Saanen, and Toggenburg. In each generation the best performing animals were selected for breeding, and as a result, a synthetic breed was created. The pedigree file contained 30,139 individuals, of which 2,799 were founders. The data set contained test-day records of milk yield, lactation number, farm, age at kidding, and year and season of kidding. Data on milk composition was unavailable. In total 1,960 animals were genotyped with the Illumina 50K caprine chip. Two methods for estimation of genomic breeding value were compared—BLUP at the single nucleotide polymorphism level (BLUP-SNP) and single-step BLUP. The highest accuracy of 0.61 was obtained with single-step BLUP, and the lowest (0.36) with BLUP-SNP. Linkage disequilibrium (r2, the squared correlation of the alleles at 2 loci) at 50 kb (distance between 2 SNP) was 0.18. This is the first attempt to implement genomic selection in UK dairy goats. Results indicate that the single-step method provides the highest accuracy for populations with a small number of genotyped individuals, where the number of genotyped males is low and females are predominant in the reference population.},

	abstract = {Genetic diversity in livestock populations is a significant contributor to the sustainability of animal production. Also, genetic diversity allows animal production to become more responsive to environmental changes and market demands. The loss of genetic diversity can result in a plateau in production and may also result in loss of fitness or viability in animal production. In this study, we investigated the rate of inbreeding (ΔF), rate of coancestry (Δf), and effective population size (Ne) as important quantitative indicators of genetic diversity and evaluated the effect of the recent implementation of genomic selection on the loss of genetic diversity in North American Holstein and Jersey dairy cattle. To estimate the rate of inbreeding and coancestry, inbreeding and coancestry coefficients were calculated using the traditional pedigree method and genomic methods estimated from segment- and marker-based approaches. Furthermore, we estimated Ne from the rate of inbreeding and coancestry and extent of linkage disequilibrium. A total of 205,755 and 89,238 pedigreed and genotyped animals born between 1990 and 2018 inclusively were available for Holsteins and Jerseys, respectively. The estimated average pedigree inbreeding coefficients were 7.74 and 7.20\% for Holsteins and Jerseys, respectively. The corresponding values for the segment and marker-by-marker genomic inbreeding coefficients were 13.61, 15.64, and 31.40\% for Holsteins and 21.16, 22.54, and 42.62\% for Jerseys, respectively. The average coancestry coefficients were 8.33 and 15.84\% for Holsteins and 9.23 and 23.46\% for Jerseys with pedigree and genomic measures, respectively. Generation interval for the whole 29-yr time period averaged approximately 5 yr for all selection pathways combined. The ΔF per generation based on pedigree, segment, and marker-by-marker genomic measures for the entire 29-yr period was estimated to be 0.75, 1.10, 1.16, and 1.02\% for Holstein animals and 0.67, 0.62, 0.63, and 0.59\% for Jersey animals, respectively. The Δf was estimated to be 0.98 and 0.98\% for Holsteins and 0.73 and 0.78\% for Jerseys with pedigree and genomic measures, respectively. These ΔF and Δf translated to an Ne that ranged from 43 to 66 animals for Holsteins and 64 to 85 animals for Jerseys. In addition, the Ne based on linkage disequilibrium was 58 and 120 for Holsteins and Jerseys, respectively. The 10-yr period that involved the application of genomic selection resulted in an increased ΔF per generation with ranges from 1.19 to 2.06\% for pedigree and genomic measures in Holsteins. Given the rate at which inbreeding is increasing after the implementation of genomic selection, there is a need to implement measures and means for controlling the rate of inbreeding per year, which will help to manage and maintain farm animal genetic resources.},

	abstract = {A new technology called genomic selection is revolutionizing dairy cattle breeding. Genomic selection refers to selection decisions based on genomic breeding values (GEBV). The GEBV are calculated as the sum of the effects of dense genetic markers, or haplotypes of these markers, across the entire genome, thereby potentially capturing all the quantitative trait loci (QTL) that contribute to variation in a trait. The QTL effects, inferred from either haplotypes or individual single nucleotide polymorphism markers, are first estimated in a large reference population with phenotypic information. In subsequent generations, only marker information is required to calculate GEBV. The reliability of GEBV predicted in this way has already been evaluated in experiments in the United States, New Zealand, Australia, and the Netherlands. These experiments used reference populations of between 650 and 4,500 progeny-tested Holstein-Friesian bulls, genotyped for approximately 50,000 genome-wide markers. Reliabilities of GEBV for young bulls without progeny test results in the reference population were between 20 and 67\%. The reliability achieved depended on the heritability of the trait evaluated, the number of bulls in the reference population, the statistical method used to estimate the single nucleotide polymorphism effects in the reference population, and the method used to calculate the reliability. A common finding in 3 countries (United States, New Zealand, and Australia) was that a straightforward BLUP method for estimating the marker effects gave reliabilities of GEBV almost as high as more complex methods. The BLUP method is attractive because the only prior information required is the additive genetic variance of the trait. All countries included a polygenic effect (parent average breeding value) in their GEBV calculation. This inclusion is recommended to capture any genetic variance not associated with the markers, and to put some selection pressure on low-frequency QTL that may not be captured by the markers. The reliabilities of GEBV achieved were significantly greater than the reliability of parental average breeding values, the current criteria for selection of bull calves to enter progeny test teams. The increase in reliability is sufficiently high that at least 2 dairy breeding companies are already marketing bull teams for commercial use based on their GEBV only, at 2 yr of age. This strategy should at least double the rate of genetic gain in the dairy industry. Many challenges with genomic selection and its implementation remain, including increasing the accuracy of GEBV, integrating genomic information into national and international genetic evaluations, and managing long-term genetic gain.},

The phenotypic database was composed by Charolais, Caracu, Aberdeen Angus, and Canchim purebred and crossbred animals. Single-trait analyses were performed using models that included the maternal effect for WW and YW traits, and a model ignoring this effect on YW (YWNM). The Deviance Information Criterion (DIC), model posterior probabilities (MPP), accuracy of breeding values (ACC), and Spearman’s rank correlation were applied to compare the models including and ignoring the maternal effect on YW. Sex and age of dam at calving had significant effects on WW and YW. The direct heritability estimates were 0.21±0.03 and 0.05±0.02, and the maternal heritabilities were 0.11±0.02 and 0.02±0.01 for WW and YW, respectively. The heritabilities estimated for YW may have been influenced by the several genetic groups in the population and by used conventional animal model, which may not have been the better fit model to evaluate YW in this population. The DIC, MPP, and ACC values indicated that YW outperformed the YWNM model, but the rank correlation and percentages of individuals selected in common suggested that the best animals would be selected independently of the model chosen.},

	abstract = {Genomics will improve the efficiency of beef cattle genetic improvement programs through the incorporation of genomic predictions into traditional genetic evaluations. The global dairy cattle breeding industry has been changed considerably in the last year through the implementation of genomic selection. Now proven to work in dairy cattle breeding, the challenge remains for the beef industry to successfully implement this technology. The primary challenge in beef cattle is the required resource population that relates genomic profile to phenotypic performance, which is quite large and its establishment will require collaboration or a significant investment by any one enterprise. Another challenge in beef cattle is the requirement for genomic predictions to function across breeds, which will require denser marker panels. Opportunities to increase genetic progress include increased accuracy of selection, reduced generation interval, increased selection intensity and better utilization of limited recording capacity, such as individual feed intake, along with opportunities to genetically change novel traits. Implementation of a low density panel at the commercial level will allow informative decisions based on genetic potential at all levels of the production chain. This reduced panel will include predictive SNP based on fine QTL mapping efforts, combined with additional SNP to enable imputation of genotypes from a high density SNP panel, when combined with high density genotypes of key ancestors, such as sires. With electronic recording in cattle, a single genotyping event on each animal would provide information throughout the beef production chain, which will create the incentive for genetic change. Genomics will create new opportunities for reproductive technologies such as embryo transfer as elite females will be identified with increased accuracy. Potential changes to the structure of the breeding industry are discussed including changes to recording strategies and the development of novel beef products.},

Primary goals are QTL detection and genomic selection. The purpose here was design of a 50–60,000 SNP chip for goats. The success of a moderate density SNP assay depends on reliable bioinformatic SNP detection procedures, the technological success rate of the SNP design, even spacing of SNPs on the genome and selection of Minor Allele Frequencies (MAF) suitable to use in diverse breeds. Through the federation of three SNP discovery projects consolidated as the International Goat Genome Consortium, we have identified approximately twelve million high quality SNP variants in the goat genome stored in a database together with their biological and technical characteristics. These SNPs were identified within and between six breeds (meat, milk and mixed): Alpine, Boer, Creole, Katjang, Saanen and Savanna, comprising a total of 97 animals. Whole genome and Reduced Representation Library sequences were aligned on {\textgreater}10 kb scaffolds of the de novo goat genome assembly. The 60,000 selected SNPs, evenly spaced on the goat genome, were submitted for oligo manufacturing (Illumina, Inc) and published in dbSNP along with flanking sequences and map position on goat assemblies (i.e. scaffolds and pseudo-chromosomes), sheep genome V2 and cattle UMD3.1 assembly. Ten breeds were then used to validate the SNP content and 52,295 loci could be successfully genotyped and used to generate a final cluster file. The combined strategy of using mainly whole genome Next Generation Sequencing and mapping on a contig genome assembly, complemented with Illumina design tools proved to be efficient in producing this GoatSNP50 chip. Advances in use of molecular markers are expected to accelerate goat genomic studies in coming years.},

Among these associations, protein–protein interactions are particularly important due to their versatility, specificity and adaptability. The STRING database aims to integrate all known and predicted associations between proteins, including both physical interactions as well as functional associations. To achieve this, STRING collects and scores evidence from a number of sources: (i) automated text mining of the scientific literature, (ii) databases of interaction experiments and annotated complexes/pathways, (iii) computational interaction predictions from co-expression and from conserved genomic context and (iv) systematic transfers of interaction evidence from one organism to another. STRING aims for wide coverage; the upcoming version 11.5 of the resource will contain more than 14 000 organisms. In this update paper, we describe changes to the text-mining system, a new scoring-mode for physical interactions, as well as extensive user interface features for customizing, extending and sharing protein networks. In addition, we describe how to query STRING with genome-wide, experimental data, including the automated detection of enriched functionalities and potential biases in the user's query data.

Users can access the TreeGrafter tool to add their own protein sequences to the reference phylogenetic trees in PANTHER, to infer evolutionary context as well as fine-grained annotations. We have added human enhancer-gene links that associate non-coding regions with the annotated human genes in PANTHER.

GCTA estimates the variance explained by all the SNPs on a chromosome or on the whole genome for a complex trait rather than testing the association of any particular SNP to the trait. We introduce GCTA's five main functions: data management, estimation of the genetic relationships from SNPs, mixed linear model analysis of variance explained by the SNPs, estimation of the linkage disequilibrium structure, and GWAS simulation. We focus on the function of estimating the variance explained by all the SNPs on the X chromosome and testing the hypotheses of dosage compensation.

At some point this constitutes an important advantage for Brazilian beef exportations because some countries look for “natural beef.”Brazilian packing plants regulate the use of antibiotics, especially ionophores used as growth promoters, on farms certified to export beef to European countries. In addition, the use of any implant or beta-agonist for cattle is forbidden in Brazil.From 1970 to 2006, the Brazilian bovine herd increased at 2.04\%/year, total pasture at 0.07\%/year, area with cultivated pasture at 3.5\%/year, and ratio of animals/hectare of total pasture at 1.97\%/year, whereas the area with natural pasture decreased at 2.26\%/year. These trends alleviate some of the pressure on Brazilian authorities with respect to deforestation of the Amazon forest.Although Brazil had the greatest growth rate of enteric methane emissions, it also had the greatest growth rate of beef production, resulting in Brazil having a negative growth rate (–1.82\%/year) of methane emissions per unit of product (kilogram of methane/kilogram of beef).},

Changes in the relative production and acceleration of production were calculated and spatialized using ARCGIS®. Cluster and canonical discriminant analyses were performed to further highlight differences between regions in terms of cattle production. The mean production point has moved from the Center of Minas Gerais State (in the southeast region) to the North of Goiás State (in the Midwest region). This reflects changes in environmental factors, such as pasture type, temperature and humidity. Acceleration in production in the northern region of Brazil has remained strong over the years. More recently, “traditional” cattle-rearing regions, such as the south and southeast, showed a reduction in growth rates as well as a reduction in herd size or internal migration over the period studied. These maps showed that this movement tends to be gradual, with few regions showing high acceleration or deceleration rates.},

	abstract = {Although animal breeding was practiced long before the science of genetics and the relevant disciplines of population and quantitative genetics were known, breeding programs have mainly relied on simply selecting and mating the best individuals on their own or relatives’ performance. This is based on sound quantitative genetic principles, developed and expounded by Lush, who attributed much of his understanding to Wright, and formalized in Fisher’s infinitesimal model. Analysis at the level of individual loci and gene frequency distributions has had relatively little impact. Now with access to genomic data, a revolution in which molecular information is being used to enhance response with “genomic selection” is occurring. The predictions of breeding value still utilize multiple loci throughout the genome and, indeed, are largely compatible with additive and specifically infinitesimal model assumptions. I discuss some of the history and genetic issues as applied to the science of livestock improvement, which has had and continues to have major spin-offs into ideas and applications in other areas.},

	abstract = {Two scientific schools have been in coexistence from the beginning of genetics, one of them searching for factors of inheritance and the other one applying biometrical models to study the relationships between relatives. With the development of molecular genetics, the possibilities of detecting genes having a noticeable effect in traits augmented. Some genes with large or medium effects were localized in animals, although the most common result was to detect markers linked to these genes, allowing the possibility of assisting selection programs with markers. When a large amount of simple and inexpensive markers were available, the SNPs, new possibilities were opened since they did not need the presence of genes of large or medium effect controlling a trait, because the whole genome was scanned. Using a large amount of SNPs permits having a prediction of the breeding value at birth accurate enough to be used in some cases, like dairy cattle, to halve its generation interval. In other animal breeding programs, the implementation of genomic selection is less clear and the way in which it can be useful should be carefully studied. The need for large populations for associating phenotypic data and markers, plus the need for repeating the process continuously, complicates its application in some cases. The implementation of the information provided by the SNPs in current genetic programs has led to the development of complex statistical tools, joining the efforts of the two schools, factorial and biometrical, that nowadays work closely related.},

          We examined Brazilian animal breeding and genetics publishing patterns to identify the major research groups and where they publish. Data was collected in Scopus and analysed in Vosviewer (version 1.615, 2020). The analyses showed that this area of knowledge is centred on groups in São Paulo state universities. Most research is on classical quantitative genetics published in Brazilian journals with a lower impact (impact factor lower than the world mean of one). Beef cattle are the main species researched, with dairy cattle and sheep also present. Less information is available on goats, poultry, swine, and equines. Research must expand to regions outside São Paulo State and beyond classical quantitative genetics. Publishing should be directed towards international journals and an increase in international collaborations. We also use the data to discuss and suggest new research areas to improve Brazil´s food security and increase sustainable animal production.},

	abstract = {Genetic progress will increase when breeders examine genotypes in addition to pedigrees and phenotypes. Genotypes for 38,416 markers and August 2003 genetic evaluations for 3,576 Holstein bulls born before 1999 were used to predict January 2008 daughter deviations for 1,759 bulls born from 1999 through 2002. Genotypes were generated using the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip and DNA from semen contributed by US and Canadian artificial-insemination organizations to the Cooperative Dairy DNA Repository. Genomic predictions for 5 yield traits, 5 fitness traits, 16 conformation traits, and net merit were computed using a linear model with an assumed normal distribution for marker effects and also using a nonlinear model with a heavier tailed prior distribution to account for major genes. The official parent average from 2003 and a 2003 parent average computed from only the subset of genotyped ancestors were combined with genomic predictions using a selection index. Combined predictions were more accurate than official parent averages for all 27 traits. The coefficients of determination (R2) were 0.05 to 0.38 greater with nonlinear genomic predictions included compared with those from parent average alone. Linear genomic predictions had R2 values similar to those from nonlinear predictions but averaged just 0.01 lower. The greatest benefits of genomic prediction were for fat percentage because of a known gene with a large effect. The R2 values were converted to realized reliabilities by dividing by mean reliability of 2008 daughter deviations and then adding the difference between published and observed reliabilities of 2003 parent averages. When averaged across all traits, combined genomic predictions had realized reliabilities that were 23\% greater than reliabilities of parent averages (50 vs. 27\%), and gains in information were equivalent to 11 additional daughter records. Reliability increased more by doubling the number of bulls genotyped than the number of markers genotyped. Genomic prediction improves reliability by tracing the inheritance of genes even with small effects.},

The objective of this study was to estimate genetic parameters for traits related to animal temperament and growth traits of Nellore cattle. In addition to exploring the genetic pattern of these traits through cluster and principal component analysis, to reveal possible groups of individuals that express less excitable temperament and greater growth. A total of 2,332 measurements from 1,245 male and female Nellore cattle born between 2008 and 2016 were utilized in the study. The (co)variance components were estimated by Bayesian inference using a two-trait animal model. The heritability for TS, FS, BCS, LW, and HH were 0.08, 0.12, 0.06, 0.13, and 0.48, respectively. The genetic correlation between the temperament indicator traits was strong and positive (0.78 ± 0.24). The TS and FS showed a favorable or null genetic correlation with LW, BCS, and HH. The third cluster included animals with low EBV for TS and FS and with high EBV for BCS, LW, and HH. In the principal component analysis, the PC1 was what best evidenced the aim of this study; thus, our findings suggest that we could explore select animals based on cluster 3 and PC1 in breeding programs to select Nellore cattle with less excitable temperament and greater growth.},

	abstract = {Directly measuring individual cow energy balance is not trivial. Other traits, like body condition score (BCS) and BCS change (ΔBCS) can, however, be used as an indicator of cow energy status. Body condition score is a metric used world-wide to estimate cow body reserves and the estimation of ΔBCS was, until now, conditional on the availability of multiple BCS assessments. The aim of the present study was to estimate ΔBCS from milk mid-infrared (MIR) spectra and days in milk (DIM) in intensively-fed dairy cows using statistical prediction methods. Daily BCS was interpolated from cubic splines fitted through the BCS records and daily ΔBCS was calculated from these splines. Body condition score change records were merged with milk MIR spectra recorded on the same week. The data set comprised 37,077 ΔBCS phenotypes across 9,403 lactations from 6,988 cows in 151 herds based in Quebec (Canada). Partial least squares regression (PLSR) and a neural network (NN) were then used to estimate ΔBCS from 1) MIR spectra only, 2) DIM only, or 3) MIR spectra and DIM together. ΔBCS data in both the first 120 DIM and 305 DIM of lactation were used to develop the estimates. Daily ΔBCS had a standard deviation of 4.40*10−3 BCS units in the 120-d data set and of 3.63*10−3 BCS units in the 305-d data set. 4-fold cross-validation was used to calibrate and test the prediction equations. External validation was also conducted using more recent years of data. Irrespective of whether based on the first 120 or 305 DIM, or when MIR spectra only, DIM only or MIR spectra and DIM were jointly used as prediction variables, NN produced the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) of cross-validation (1.81*10−3 BCS units and 1.51*10−3 BCS units, respectively, using the 120-d and 305-d data set). Relative to predictions for the entire 305 DIM, the RMSE of cross-validation was 15.4\% and 1.5\% lower in the first 120 DIM when using PLSR and NN, respectively. Predictions from DIM only were more accurate than those using just MIR spectra data but, irrespective of the data set and of the prediction model used, the combining DIM information with MIR spectral data as prediction variables reduced the RMSE compared with inclusion of DIM alone, albeit the benefit was small (the RMSE from cross-validation was reduced up to 5.5\% when DIM and spectral data were jointly used as model features instead of DIM only). However, when predicting extreme ΔBCS records, the MIR spectral data was more informative than DIM. Model performance when predicting ΔBCS records in future years was similar to that from cross-validation demonstrating the ability of MIR spectra of milk and DIM combined to estimate ΔBCS, particularly in early lactation. This can be used to routinely generate estimates of ΔBCS to aid in day-to-day individual cow management.},

	abstract = {This study aimed at evaluating the quality of imputation accuracy (IA) by marker (IAm) and by individual (IAi) in US crossbred dairy cattle. Holstein × Jersey crossbreds were used to evaluate imputation accuracy from a low (7K) to medium density (50K) SNP chip. Crossbred animals, as well as their sires (53), dams (77), and maternal grandsires (63), were all genotyped with a 78K SNP chip. Seven different scenarios of reference populations were tested in which some scenarios used different family relationships and some other added random unrelated purebred and crossbred individuals to those different family relationship scenarios. The same scenarios were tested on Holstein and Jersey purebred animals to compare these outcomes to those attained in crossbred animals. The genotype imputation was performed with findhap (version 4) software. There were no significant differences in IA results depending on whether the sire of imputed individuals was Holstein and the dam was Jersey, or vice versa. The IA increased significantly with the addition of related individuals in the reference population, from 86.70 ± 0.06\% when only sires or dams were included in the reference population to 90.09 ± 0.06\% when sires, dams, and maternal grandsires genomic information were combined in the reference population. In all scenarios including related individuals in the reference population, IAm and IAi were significantly superior in purebred Jersey and Holstein animals than in crossbreds, ranging from 90.75 ± 0.06 to 94.02 ± 0.06\%, and from 90.88 ± 0.11 to 94.04 ± 0.10\%, respectively. Additionally, a scenario called SPB+DLD that is similar to the genomic evaluations performed on US crossbred dairy was tested. In this scenario, the information from the 5 evaluated breeds (Ayrshire, Brown Swiss, Guernsey, Holstein, and Jersey) genotyped with a 50K SNP chip and genomic information from the dams genotyped with a 7K SNP chip were combined in the reference population and the IAm and IAi were 80.87 ± 0.06\%, and 80.85 ± 0.08\%, respectively. Adding randomly nonrelated genotyped individuals in the reference population reduced IA for both purebred and crossbred cows, except for scenario SPB+DLD, where adding crossbreds to the reference population increased IA values. Our findings demonstrate that IA for US Holstein × Jersey crossbred ranged from 85 to 90\%, and emphasize the significance of designing and defining the reference population for improved IA.},

After reference genome aligning, CNV calling, and annotation, we screened identified CNVs in the high-fecundity (HF) and low-fecundity (LF) groups to identify discrepant CNVs and their distribution within the genome.

	abstract = {It was reasoned that, incorporating reproductive technologies and genomic selection in the current dairy goats breeding programme would generate higher response to selection compared to use of natural mating in the current conventional breeding programme. This premise was tested by deterministic simulation approach and compared to the current breeding programme where natural mating and conventional breeding programme is used in the tropics. Two breeding schemes with three breeding strategies were simulated. The first scheme was conventional breeding scheme (CS) which represented the current dairy goat-breeding programme in the tropics. An alternative scheme was genomic breeding scheme (GS). Each scheme was evaluated with three mating strategies. They include; conventional scheme using natural mating (CNM), AI-Liquid semen (CLS) and AI-Frozen semen (CFS), and genomic scheme using natural mating (GNM), AI-Liquid semen (GLS) and AI-Frozen semen (GFS) strategies, with 5\% of the total population in the nucleus and 95 \% in the commercial. The current study found that CLS and GLS were superior compared to CFS and GFS, and CNM and GNM strategies in terms of annual genetic gain, returns and profit per doe per year. The CLS realised additional Kenya Shillings (KES) 3.00 and 3.61, 151.31 and KES 46.72, 148.89 and 47.81, in genetic gain, returns and profitability compared to CNM and CFS, respectively. The CLS incurred low costs KES 23.38 compared to CFS with KES 24.47 but higher than CNM with KES 20.96. On the other hand, CFS strategy has generated additional returns KES 104.59 and profit KES 101.08 but lower by KES 0.61 in genetic gain compared to CNM strategy. Implementation of genomic scheme has generated additional improvement across the three mating strategies in all the parameters measured compared to the conventional scheme. The GS realised additional KES 11.54, 10.80 and 10.21 in genetic gain, KES 161.30, 183.48 and 175.90 returns, and 136.30, 158.48 and 150.90 profit in the GNM, GLS and GFS, respectively, compared to those realised in CNM, CLS and CFS. Genetic gain increased with increased nucleus population size up to 15 \% and thereafter, it declines in both CS and GS schemes with optimal nucleus size ranging between 14 \% and 16 \%. In conclusion, the current study demonstrated that adoption of reproductive technologies such as AI would optimize response to selection in dairy goat breeding programs in the tropics. The response to selection in such breeding programmes could be maximized in combination with genomic selection.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to test whether the use of X-semen in a dairy cattle population using genomic selection (GS) and multiple ovulation and embryo transfer (MOET) increases the selection intensity on cow dams and thereby the genetic gain in the entire population. Also, the dynamics of using different types of sexed semen (X, Y or conventional) in the nucleus were investigated. The stochastic simulation study partly supported the hypothesis as the genetic gain in the entire population was elevated when X-semen was used in the production population as GS exploited the higher selection intensity among heifers with great accuracy. However, when MOET was applied, the effect was considerably diminished as was the exchange of females between the nucleus and the production population, thus causing modest genetic profit from using X-sorted semen in the production population. In addition, the effect of using sexed semen on the genetic gain was very small compared with the effect of MOET and highly dependent on whether cow dams or bull dams were inseminated with sexed semen and on what type of semen that was used for the bull dams. The rate of inbreeding was seldom affected by the use of sexed semen. However, when all young bull candidates were born following MOET, the results showed that the use of Y-semen in the breeding nucleus tended to decrease the rate of inbreeding as it enabled GS to increase within-family selection. This implies that the benefit from using sexed semen in a modern dairy cattle breeding scheme applying both GS and MOET may be found in its beneficial effect on the rate of inbreeding.},

	abstract = {The objective of the present study was to examine whether genomic selection of females interacts with the use of reproductive technologies (RT) to increase annual monetary genetic gain (AMGG). This was tested using a factorial design with 3 factors: genomic selection of females (0 or 2,000 genotyped heifers per year), RT (0 or 50 donors selected at 14mo of age for producing 10 offspring), and 2 reliabilities of genomic prediction. In addition, different strategies for use of RT and how strategies interact with the reliability of genomic prediction were investigated using stochastic simulation by varying (1) number of donors (25, 50, 100, 200), (2) number of calves born per donor (10 or 20), (3) age of donor (2 or 14mo), and (4) number of sires (25, 50, 100, 200). In total, 72 different breeding schemes were investigated. The profitability of the different breeding strategies was evaluated by deterministic simulation by varying the costs of a born calf with reproductive technologies at levels of €500, €1,000, and €1,500. The results confirm our hypothesis that combining genomic selection of females with use of RT increases AMGG more than in a reference scheme without genomic selection in females. When the reliability of genomic prediction is high, the effect on rate of inbreeding (ΔF) is small. The study also demonstrates favorable interaction effects between the components of the breeder’s equation (selection intensity, selection accuracy, generation interval) for the bull dam donor path, leading to higher AMGG. Increasing the donor program and number of born calves to achieve higher AMGG is associated with the undesirable effect of increased ΔF. This can be alleviated, however, by increasing the numbers of sires without compromising AMGG remarkably. For the major part of the investigated donor schemes, the investment in RT is profitable in dairy cattle populations, even at high levels of costs for RT.},

	abstract = {Heat stress is a prominent issue in livestock production, even for intensively housed dairy herds in Canada. Production records and meteorological data can be combined to assess heat tolerance in dairy cattle. The overall aim of this study was to evaluate the possibility of genetic evaluation for heat tolerance in Canadian dairy cattle. The 2 specific objectives were: 1) to estimate the genetic parameters for milk, fat, and protein yield for Holsteins while accounting for high environmental heat loads, and 2) to determine if a genotype-by-environment interaction causes re-ranking of top-ranked sires between environments with low and high heat loads. A repeatability test-day model with a heat stress function was used to evaluate the genetic merit for milk, fat, and protein yield under heat stress and at thermal comfort for first parity in 5 regions in Canada. The heat stress function for each trait was defined using a specific temperature-humidity index (THI) threshold. The purpose of this function was to quantify the level of heat stress that was experienced by the dairy cattle. The estimated genetic correlation between the general additive genetic effect and the additive effect on the slope of the change in the trait phenotype for milk, fat, and protein yield ranged from −0.16 to −0.30, −0.20 to −0.44, and −0.28 to −0.42, respectively. These negative correlations imply that there is an antagonistic relationship between sensitivity to heat stress and level of production. The heritabilities for milk, fat, and protein yield at 15 units above the THI threshold ranged from 0.15 to 0.27, 0.11 to 0.15, and 0.11 to 0.15, respectively. Finally, the rank correlations between the breeding values from a repeatability model with no heat stress effect and the breeding values accounting for heat stress for the 100 top-ranked bulls indicated possible interaction between milk production traits and THI, resulting in substantial re-ranking of the top-ranked sires in Canada, especially for milk yield. This is the first study to implement NASA POWER weather data in a genetic evaluation of heat tolerance in dairy cattle. NASA POWER is a novel alternative meteorological resource that is potentially more reliable and consistent and with broader coverage than weather station data increasing the number of animals that could be included in a heat stress evaluation.},

Four samplings were carried out seasonally between June 2010 and July 2011, in 12 collecting sites distributed from the headwater to the mouth of Água das Araras stream and its tributaries, using seines and gill nets to capture specimens. A total of 5,328 specimens were collected, distributed in six orders, 15 families, 33 genera, and 41 species. The most representative orders, in terms of species richness, were Siluriformes and Characiformes. Among the families, Characidae (eight species) and Loricariidae (seven species) presented higher richness contributing together with approximately 36.6\% of all collected species. The most frequent species captured in ≥75\% of the sampled sites were Astyanax lacustris, Characidium aff. zebra, Corydoras aeneus, and Imparfinis schubarti. The classifi­ cation of species with the Kendeigh Index highlighted the following ranking of the more abundant species: Phalloceros harpagos, C. aeneus, A. lacustris, and I. schubarti. Finally, our results emphasize the importance of sampling small aquatic bodies, revealing their potential for main­ taining a significant portion of fish diversity in Neotropical freshwater environments.},

This study reported C. hypselurus in a headwater of Cinzas River basin, where there were no previous records of this species, and employed microsatellite loci and mitochondrial haplotypes in a population genetic analysis. A total of 57 specimens was analyzed, including 30 from Cinzas River basin, 25 from Itararé River basin and two from Tibagi River basin. Results indicated low genetic diversity levels (HE = 0.334 and h = 0.246) for the sample from Cinzas River, suggesting reflections of a founder effect after the species had dispersed from one watershed to another, possibly by headwater captures. Since different populations were detected between the Cinzas and Itararé rivers (DEST = 0.248, P-value {\textless} 0.05) and other occurrence sites are still unknown in the Cinzas River basin, the data herein have great relevance and should be taken into account in future management and conservation actions, as well as in evolutionary studies of C. hypselurus.},

Damming a river changes the flow and landscape characteristics, which, in turn, change the hydrological, limnological and ecological dynamics, such as biological production, species distribution, and ecosystem structuring, functioning and services. This study evaluates the distribution pattern of the Siluriformes (catfish) fish species near a small hydroelectric power plant in the Jaguariaíva River, considering three distinct distances from the dam: upstream region, reservoir and downstream region. Samples were taken with gillnets between March 2013 and December 2014. The abundance and richness of the Siluriformes species were evaluated. A permutational multivariate analysis of variance was used to access possible differences in species composition among sites. Finally, a permutational analysis of multivariate dispersion was used to assess possible differences among sampling sites and to examine composition similarities among sites. A total of 840 Siluriformes individuals were captured, distributed among ten species and four families. The highest richness was observed in the downstream region, while the lowest richness was observed in the reservoir area. Differences in the abundance of species were observed between the three distinct regions; the downstream region presented the highest species abundance (CPUE), whereas the lowest abundance was observed in the dam region. Hypostomus paulinus and Hypostomus strigaticeps were abundant species, but exclusively sampled in the downstream region, while Corydoras ehrhardti and Cambeva diabola presented their highest abundance in the upstream region. The distinct longitudinal distribution of Siluriformes observed in this study can be interpreted as indicative of the negative effects of damming. Our study suggests that building small dams may result in negative impacts on the fish assemblage, impacts comparable to those of large reservoirs in terms of spatial changes. It is fundamentally necessary to better evaluate the environmental impacts of small dams in the Neotropical region, especially because few is known about them and how such impacts are comparable to impacts of larger reservoirs.},

            In the Neotropics, freshwater streams harbour high fish diversity and are constantly threatened by anthropogenic disturbance. However, there are few studies on the genetic diversity of fish populations inhabiting these streams. We aimed to assess, based on microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA markers, the population structure and genetic diversity of the suckermouth catfish, Hypostomus ancistroides, a Neotropical species widely distributed across the Upper Paraná River Basin in South America. Twenty-five locations were sampled, distributed across 18 sites in six tributary streams and another seven sites in the main river channel. Our analyses revealed a spatial heterogeneity in genetic diversity within the basin, indicating fine-scale genetic structuring. Samples from all streams showed exclusive haplotypes and private alleles, reinforcing the importance of preserving the tributaries for the conservation of the genetic diversity of the studied populations. The fine-scale genetic structuring of H. ancistroides is probably related to the limited displacement capacity of this species.},

Throughout its course, there is only a low-height dam, including a transposition system located 98 km from its mouth. The sampling was carried out in nine locations, from the source to the mouth, with six field incursions in each location, using different fishing gear. A total of 11,924 fish were collected, distributed in seven orders, 27 families, and 100 species. The most representative order in the number of species was Siluriformes, followed by Characiformes. As for the families, Loricariidae comprised 21\% and Characidae 14\% of species richness. Phalloceros harpagos was the species with the highest absolute abundance, representing 11.3\% of the total, followed by Hypostomus ancistroides with 9.8\%. However, considering the average abundance and frequency of occurrence, Hypostomus ancistroides was the most abundant species, followed by Hypostomus cf. paulinus, Psalidodon aff. paranae and Phalloceros harpagos. Among the collected species, the Apteronotus acidops, Brycon orbygnianus, Brycon nattereri, Crenicichla jupiaensis, and Rhinelepis aspera were classified as endangered on the most recent IUCN Red List. Also, from the total sampled fish, 9.8\% are considered non-native species. Among the native species recorded, 10 species are large migratory species, which indicates that the Laranjinha River is a route for spawning and maintenance of species diversity in the middle Paranapanema River.

In general, the banks of the Penacho Stream are predominantly characterized by pasture or agricultural activities and may exhibit little riparian vegetation in few stretches. Fishes were collected at eight different locations, from its headwaters to its mouth, between February 2009 to March 2010. A total of seven orders, twelve families and thirty-three species, three of which not native to the basin, were reported. The fish species captured along the Penacho stream are those that still manage to stay in those environments, even in changed conditions. However, to better understand the effects of degradation on fish diversity, it is necessary to monitor it along time.},

Populations of this species have been very rare in some Paraná River sub basins. This study analyzes the genetic diversity and population structure of B. nattereri in a restricted area of occurrence recently identified in upper Paraná River basin. Seven microsatellite loci and 497 bp of D-Loop mitochondrial region were examined in 92 individuals from four points along the area of occurrence. Both molecular markers indicated a single population distributed along a stretch of the river approximately 80 km long. Although some of the data suggest an ancient bottleneck, current levels of genetic diversity (HE = 0.574 and h = 0.616) were similar to those of other species of the genus Brycon. The results suggest that the population of B. nattereri has been able to maintain satisfactory levels of genetic diversity, in spite of the small area of occurrence. These data have highlighted an important conservation area and action may prove essential to improve the quality of the environment, and especially the water and riparian plant life, if the area is to be managed and conserved efficiently.},

Thirty individuals of this species were collected from three sites throughout the upper Cambe´ stream. A total of 10 primers ampliﬁed 159 loci, of which 128 (80.5\%) were polymorphic. Each of the three populations showed very similar proportions of polymorphic loci, which ranged from 63.5 to 64.8\%. Unbiased genetic distances varied from 0.0612 to 0.0646. Thetap-test values indicated moderate to high genetic diﬀerentiation among individuals from diﬀerent localities. The number of migrants varied from 1.34 to 1.46, suggesting a low gene ﬂow between populations. The genetic similarity among all individuals studied ranged from 0.424 to 0.848.

The 11 primers used in RAPD analysis amplified 147 loci, 76 (51.7\%) of which were polymorphic. The proportions of polymorphic loci observed in the four samples were: 29.93\% (S1), 31.97\% (S2), 23.81\% (S3) and 38.77\% (S4). The average heterozygosity within sampling localities ranged from 0.1230 to 0.1526 and unbiased genetic distances ranged from 0.0253 to 0.0445. AMOVA partitioned 90.85\% of the total variation within samples and 9.15\% among samples. Excepting for the sample pair S1-S2 (φST = 0.02784; p {\textgreater} 0.05), all others pairwise φST values were significantly greater than zero, indicating moderate genetic differentiation among catfish samples from four localities. The relative low levels of genetic variation detected in all groups studied could be related to different factors, including the sedentary habit of these fish, which can be eroding the genetic variation of H. ancistroides from each locality.},

	abstract = {In view of the growing global demand for electricity, many countries have been looking for ways to diversify production. However, in countries such as Brazil, hydroelectric power plants still constitute the predominant generating source, occupying important drainage systems, such as the Upper Paraná River. At the same time, hydroelectric dams are among the main sources of impacts on freshwater fish, interfering, for example, in the genetic distribution of populations. Although the same could be expected from Small Hydroelectric Plants, very little genetic information has been obtained along Neotropical drainages. Based on this, the present study analyzed the DNA (microsatellite loci) of non-migratory fish species (seven) upstream and down­ stream of three Small Hydroelectric Plants in the Upper Paraná River basin, obtaining information about the genetic distribution of fish populations in this scenario. In general, the data suggest that populations have been genetically subdivided by Small Hydroelectric Plants and that other factors, such as the number of Small Hydroelectric Plants along a drainage and connectivity with long free stretches, could also influence genetic differentiation levels, which provides information of great relevance to global discussions about the impacts of hydroelectric power plants, as well as for the implementation and management of projects.},

Os peixes foram confinados in situ em cinco pontos ao longo de um ribeirão localizado em área de produção agrícola e em um córrego dentro de um fragmento florestal, considerado um local de referência. Após sete dias foram observadas as seguintes alterações nos peixes confinados nos pontos experimentais: aumento da atividade da glutationa-S-transferase (GST) e catalase (CAT) e aumento do conteúdo de glutationa-reduzida (GSH) em fígado e brânquias, redução da atividade da acetilcolinesterase (AChE) no músculo e cérebro, aumento de quebras no DNA e na frequência de micronúcleos (MN) e alterações nucleares (ENA) em eritrócitos. O IBR destacou três dos pontos estudados como os mais afetados pela contaminação agrícola, uma vez que foram observados nos animais confinados nestes locais maiores variações nas respostas biológicas.

Throughout its course, there is only a low-height dam, including a transposition system located 98 km from its mouth. The sampling was carried out in nine locations, from the source to the mouth, with six field incursions in each location, using different fishing gear. A total of 11,924 fish were collected, distributed in seven orders, 27 families, and 100 species. The most representative order in the number of species was Siluriformes, followed by Characiformes. As for the families, Loricariidae comprised 21\% and Characidae 14\% of species richness. Phalloceros harpagos was the species with the highest absolute abundance, representing 11.3\% of the total, followed by Hypostomus ancistroides with 9.8\%. However, considering the average abundance and frequency of occurrence, Hypostomus ancistroides was the most abundant species, followed by Hypostomus cf. paulinus, Psalidodon aff. paranae and Phalloceros harpagos. Among the collected species, the Apteronotus acidops, Brycon orbygnianus, Brycon nattereri, Crenicichla jupiaensis, and Rhinelepis aspera were classified as endangered on the most recent IUCN Red List. Also, from the total sampled fish, 9.8\% are considered non-native species. Among the native species recorded, 10 species are large migratory species, which indicates that the Laranjinha River is a route for spawning and maintenance of species diversity in the middle Paranapanema River. Therefore, the Laranjinha River is a heritage of fish diversity and deserves special attention in its preservation.},

	abstract = {Heritability (h2) represents the potential for short-term response of a quantitative trait to selection. Unfortunately, estimating h2 through traditional crossing experiments is not practical for many species, and even for those in which mating can be manipulated, it may not be possible to assay them in ecologically relevant environments. We evaluated an approach, GCTA, that uses relatedness estimated from genomic data to estimate the proportion of phenotypic variance due to genotyped SNPs, which can be used to infer h2. Using phenotypic and genotypic data from eight replicates of experimentally grown plants of the annual legume Medicago truncatula, we examined how h2 estimates from GCTA (h2GCTA) related to traditional estimates of heritability (clonal repeatability for these inbred lines). Further, we examined how h2GCTA estimates were affected by SNP number, minor allele frequency, the number of individuals assayed and the exclusion of causative SNPs. We found that the average h2GCTA estimates for each trait made with the full data set ({\textgreater}5 million SNPs, 200 individuals) were strongly correlated (r = 0·99) with estimates of clonal repeatability. However, this result masks considerable variation among replicate estimates of h2GCTA, even in relatively uniform greenhouse conditions. h2GCTA estimates with 250 000 and 25 000 SNPs were very similar to those obtained with {\textgreater}5 million SNPs, but with 2500 SNPs, h2GCTA were lower and had higher variance than those with ≥25 k SNPs. h2GCTA estimates were slightly lower when only common SNPs were used. Excluding putatively causative SNPs had little effect on the estimates of h2GCTA, suggesting that genotyping putatively causative SNPs is not necessary to obtain accurate estimates of h2. The number of accessions sampled had the greatest effect on h2GCTA estimates, and variance greatly increased as fewer accessions were included. With only 50 accessions sampled, the range of h2GCTA ranged from 0 to 1 for all traits. These results indicate that the GCTA method may be useful for estimating h2 using data sets of a size that are available from reduced-representation genotyping but that hundreds of individuals may need to be sampled to obtain robust estimates of h2.},

In the ﬁrst step, a historical population is simulated to establish mutation-drift equilibrium, and in the second step, recent population structures are generated, which can be very complex. A wide variety of genome architectures, ranging from inﬁnitesimal model to single-locus model, can be simulated. The program is efﬁcient in terms of computing time and memory requirements.},

	abstract = {Goat plays a crucial role in human livelihoods, being a major source of meat, milk, fiber, and hides, particularly under adverse climatic conditions. The goat genomics related to the candidate gene approach is now being used to recognize molecular mechanisms that have different expressions of growth, reproductive, milk, wool, and disease resistance. The appropriate literature on this topic has been reviewed in this article. Several genetic characterization attempts of different goats have reported the existence of genotypic and morphological variations between different goat populations. As a result, different whole-genome sequences along with annotated gene sequences, gene function, and other genomic information of different goats are available in different databases. The main objective of this review is to search the genes associated with economic traits in goats. More than 271 candidate genes have been discovered in goats. Candidate genes influence the physiological pathway, metabolism, and expression of phenotypes. These genes have different functions on economically important traits. Some genes have pleiotropic effect for expression of phenotypic traits. Hence, recognizing candidate genes and their mutations that cause variations in gene expression and phenotype of an economic trait can help breeders look for genetic markers for specific economic traits. The availability of reference whole-genome assembly of goats, annotated genes, and transcriptomics makes comparative genomics a useful tool for systemic genetic upgradation. Identification and characterization of trait-associated sequence variations and gene will provide powerful means to give positive influences for future goat breeding program.},

The data used consisted of 49,696 monthly test-day records of milk (MY), protein (PY), fat (FY), and dry matter (DMY) yields from 5,163 goats, distributed in 20 herds, offspring of 2,086 does and 206 bucks. These records were analyzed by 2-trait random regression models (RRM) and a repeatability test-day model (RTDM). At the middle of lactation, heritability estimates for MY, DMY, and FY obtained with RTDM were larger than those estimated with RRM, and the opposite was true for PY. The RRM estimates of heritability for MY, FY, and PY were very similar throughout the trajectories of both lactations. Heritability estimates for DMY decreased through the lactation period. The genetic correlations between the first and second lactation records estimated for all traits by RRM were positive and ranged from 0.43 to 0.80 throughout the lactation curves. The correlation between BV estimated with RTDM and RRM was 0.742 for MY and 0.664 for DMY. The RRM could be a useful alternative to RTDM for the prediction of BV in this breed.},

In addition, sheep are used in biomedical research as a model organism for heart, lung, and musculoskeletal diseases. A better understanding of the genetic makeup of sheep will lead to improvements in the efficiency of meat, milk, and wool production and contribute to a better understanding of health and disease issues in humans. While several genetic regions associated with economically and biologically important traits in sheep have been identified, the number of known causative mutations is relatively small. However, the development and application of a high-density ovine SNP array and the availability of the whole genome assembly for sheep will undoubtedly lead to more discoveries. It should be noted that the application of genetic markers for selection of quantitative traits in sheep is still in the distant future.},

	abstract = {Background:  Since goat was domesticated 10,000 years ago, many factors have contributed to the differentiation of goat breeds and these are classified mainly into two types: (i) adaptation to different breeding systems and/or purposes and (ii) adaptation to different environments. As a result, approximately 600 goat breeds have developed worldwide; they differ considerably from one another in terms of phenotypic characteristics and are adapted to a wide range of climatic conditions. In this work, we analyzed the AdaptMap goat dataset, which is composed of data from more than 3000 animals collected worldwide and genotyped with the CaprineSNP50 BeadChip. These animals were partitioned into groups based on geographical area, production uses, available records on solid coat color and environmental variables including the sampling geographical coordinates, to investigate the role of natural and/or artificial selection in shaping the genome of goat breeds.
Results:  Several signatures of selection on different chromosomal regions were detected across the different breeds, sub-geographical clusters, phenotypic and climatic groups. These regions contain genes that are involved in impor‑tant biological processes, such as milk-, meat- or fiber-related production, coat color, glucose pathway, oxidative stress response, size, and circadian clock differences. Our results confirm previous findings in other species on adaptation to extreme environments and human purposes and provide new genes that could explain some of the differences between goat breeds according to their geographical distribution and adaptation to different environments.
Conclusions:  These analyses of signatures of selection provide a comprehensive first picture of the global domesti‑cation process and adaptation of goat breeds and highlight possible genes that may have contributed to the differen‑tiation of this species worldwide.},

The objective of this study was to typologize the lactation curves in French dairy goats and analyze the influence of environmental and genetic factors on these curves. The data set consisted of 2,231,720 monthly test-day records of 213,534 French Saanen and Alpine goats recorded between September 2008 and June 2012. First, principal component analysis classified the shape of the lactation curves into 3 principal components: the first component accounted for milk yield level throughout lactation, the second component accounted for lactation persistency, and the third component accounted for milk yield in mid-lactation. Then, from the principal component scores, the lactations were clustered into 5 different groups. Most lactations had a similar shape to the mean curve, except 30\% of the lactations that fell into 3 clusters that had a high production level at the peak and then a different persistency according to cluster. Estimated breeding value for milk yield and home region of breeding were the factors most related to lactation production level. Month of kidding, breed, and gestation stage had the biggest effect on persistency. Month of kidding was the factor most strongly linked to mid-lactation production. A herd effect was observed on all 3 principal components.},

Algorithms were derived and computer programs tested with simulated data for 2,967 bulls and 50,000 markers distributed randomly across 30 chromosomes. Estimation of genomic inbreeding coefficients required accurate estimates of allele frequencies in the base population. Linear model predictions of breeding values were computed by 3 equivalent methods: 1) iteration for individual allele effects followed by summation across loci to obtain estimated breeding values, 2) selection index including a genomic relationship matrix, and 3) mixed model equations including the inverse of genomic relationships. A blend of firstand second-order Jacobi iteration using 2 separate relaxation factors converged well for allele frequencies and effects. Reliability of predicted net merit for young bulls was 63\% compared with 32\% using the traditional relationship matrix. Nonlinear predictions were also computed using iteration on data and nonlinear regression on marker deviations; an additional (about 3\%) gain in reliability for young bulls increased average reliability to 66\%. Computing times increased linearly with number of genotypes. Estimation of allele frequencies required 2 processor days, and genomic predictions required {\textless}1 d per trait, and traits were processed in parallel. Information from genotyping was equivalent to about 20 daughters with phenotypic records. Actual gains may differ because the simulation did not account for linkage disequilibrium in the base population or selection in subsequent generations.},

Spectral data were considered a set of covariates, in addition to genomic covariates. Milk yield and somatic cell score were used as traits to investigate. A cross-validation was employed, making a distinction for predicting new individuals’ performance under known environments, known individuals’ performance under new environments, and new individuals’ performance under new environments. We found an advantage of including spectral data as environmental covariates when the genomic predictions had to be extrapolated to new environments. This was valid for both observed and, even more, unobserved families (genotypes). Overall, prediction accuracy was larger for milk yield than somatic cell score. Fourier-transformed infrared spectral data can be used as a source of information for the calculation of the ‘environmental coordinates’ of a given farm in a given time, extrapolating predictions to new environments. This procedure could serve as an example of integration of genomic and phenomic data. This could help using spectral data for traits that present poor predictability at the phenotypic level, such as disease incidence and behavior traits. The strength of the model is the ability to couple genomic with high-throughput phenomic information.},

	abstract = {Identity by descent (IBD) is a fundamental concept in genetics and refers to alleles that are descended from a common ancestor in a base population. Identity by state (IBS) simply refers to alleles that are the same, irrespective of whether they are inherited from a recent ancestor. In modern applications, IBD relationships are estimated from genetic markers in individuals without any known relationship. This can lead to erroneous inference because a consistent base population is not used. We argue that the purpose of most IBD calculations is to predict IBS at unobserved loci. Recognizing this aim leads to better methods to estimating IBD with benefits in mapping genes, estimating genetic variance and predicting inbreeding depression.},

	abstract = {The present study was conducted to understand the present and future perspective of milk production in Karnataka and to develop a suitable model for prediction of milk production in the state. The present study is having advantage as the past trends of milk production in the state have been impressive with growth, contributing significantly to overall milk production in the country. The Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models were applied to the data sets of different dairy units for modeling and forecasting milk production in the state. The milk production of different dairy units has indicated a significant and positive trend over the years (Mann Kendal and Sen's estimator). The purpose of the study was based on the accuracy criteria to identify the best ARIMA and ANN models for forecasting. It was found that the ARIMA model predicted cows, goats, and total milk production with better R-Square, MAPE and percentage prediction error compared to ANN models. ANN model performed better in predicting the buffalo's milk yield compared to the ARIMA model. The best-identified models were used for out-sample forecast.},

	abstract = {Autopolyploids present several challenges to researchers studying population genetics, since almost all population genetics theory, and the expectations derived from this theory, has been developed for haploids and diploids. Also many statistical tools for the analysis of genetic data, such as AMOVA and genome scans, are available only for haploids and diploids. In this paper, we show how the Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) framework can be extended to include autopolyploid data, which will allow calculating several genetic summary statistics for estimating the strength of genetic differentiation among autopolyploid populations (FST, φST, or RST). We show how this can be done by adjusting the equations for calculating the Sums of Squares, degrees of freedom and covariance components. The method can be applied to a dataset containing a single ploidy level, but also to datasets with a mixture of ploidy levels. In addition, we show how AMOVA can be used to estimate the summary statistic ρ, which was developed especially for polyploid data, but unfortunately has seen very little use. The ρ-statistic can be calculated in an AMOVA by first calculating a matrix of squared Euclidean distances for all pairs of individuals, based on the within-individual allele frequencies. The ρ-statistic is well suited for polyploid data since its expected value is independent of the ploidy level, the rate of double reduction, the frequency of polysomic inheritance, and the mating system. We tested the method using data simulated under a hierarchical island model: the results of the analyses of the simulated data closely matched the values derived from theoretical expectations. The problem of missing dosage information cannot be taken into account directly into the analysis, but can be remedied effectively by imputation of the allele frequencies. We hope that the development of AMOVA for autopolyploids will help to narrow the gap in availability of statistical tools for diploids and polyploids. We also hope that this research will increase the adoption of the ploidy-independent ρ-statistic, which has many qualities that makes it better suited for comparisons among species than the standard FST, both for diploids and for polyploids.},

	abstract = {We present here a framework for the study of molecular variation within a single species. Information on DNA haplotype divergence is incorporated into an analysis of variance format, derived from a matrix of squared-distances among all pairs of haplotypes. This analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) produces estimates of variance components and F-statistic analogs, designated here as phi-statistics, reflecting the correlation of haplotypic diversity at different levels of hierarchical subdivision. The method is flexible enough to accommodate several alternative input matrices, corresponding to different types of molecular data, as well as different types of evolutionary assumptions, without modifying the basic structure of the analysis. The significance of the variance components and phi-statistics is tested using a permutational approach, eliminating the normality assumption that is conventional for analysis of variance but inappropriate for molecular data. Application of AMOVA to human mitochondrial DNA haplotype data shows that population subdivisions are better resolved when some measure of molecular differences among haplotypes is introduced into the analysis. At the intraspecific level, however, the additional information provided by knowing the exact phylogenetic relations among haplotypes or by a nonlinear translation of restriction-site change into nucleotide diversity does not significantly modify the inferred population genetic structure. Monte Carlo studies show that site sampling does not fundamentally affect the significance of the molecular variance components. The AMOVA treatment is easily extended in several different directions and it constitutes a coherent and flexible framework for the statistical analysis of molecular data.},

	abstract = {We formalize the use of allele frequency and geographic information for the construction of gene trees at the intraspecific level and extend the concept of evolutionary parsimony to molecular variance parsimony. The central principle is to consider a particular gene tree as a variable to be optimized in the estimation of a given population statistic. We propose three population statistics that are related to variance components and that are explicit functions of phylogenetic information. The methodology is applied in the context of minimum spanning trees (MSTs) and human mitochondrial DNA restriction data, but could be extended to accommodate other tree-making procedures, as well as other data types. We pursue optimal trees by heuristic optimization over a search space of more than 1.29 billion MSTs. This very large number of equally parsimonious trees underlines the lack of resolution of conventional parsimony procedures. This lack of resolution is highlighted by the observation that equally parsimonious trees yield very different estimates of population genetic diversity and genetic structure, as shown by null distributions of the population statistics, obtained by evaluation of 10,000 random MSTs. We propose a non-parametric test for the similarity between any two trees, based on the distribution of a weighted coevolutionary correlation. The ability to test for tree relatedness leads to the definition of a class of solutions instead of a single solution. Members of the class share virtually all of the critical internal structure of the tree but differ in the placement of singleton branch tips.},

	abstract = {Populations may, during their evolutionary history, go through drastic changes in population size due to bottlenecks or founder events upon colonization of new areas. This involves a subsample of haplotypes, causing the allele frequencies to be different from the original population. In addition, the period of recovery after a bottleneck can be of considerable length. If reproduction is unequal among individuals but random with regard to haplotype, large deviations from the patterns expected in a stable population may result. By means of computer simulation, I have analysed the patterns arising when populations undergo bottlenecks and then slowly recover, and used two new statistical tests for the detection of the bottleneck. A test based on the variance of the relative frequency of haplotypes had generally high power even at low sample size (n=25). This statistic was most powerful after very strong bottlenecks and lost power with increasing propagule size. A test based on the variance of the pairwise differences shows slightly less power. As expected, power was reduced when migration into the founder population was allowed from the source population. This suggests that the test is particularly suited for detecting relatively recent and strong bottlenecks, and thus may be a valuable tool for identifying population events on a fine temporal scale, such as colonisations after the last glaciation.},

	abstract = {Distributions of pairwise differences often called “mismatch distributions” have been extensively used to estimate the demographic parameters of past population expansions. However, these estimations relied on the assumption that all mutations occurring in the ancestry of a pair of genes lead to observable differences (the inﬁnite-sites model). This mutation model may not be very realistic, especially in the case of the control region of mitochondrial DNA, where this methodology has been mostly applied. In this article, we show how to infer past demographic parameters by explicitly taking into account a ﬁnite-sites model with heterogeneity of mutation rates. We also propose an alternative way to derive conﬁdence intervals around the estimated parameters, based on a bootstrap approach. By checking the validity of these conﬁdence intervals by simulations, we ﬁnd that only those associated with the timing of the expansion are approximately correctly estimated, while those around the population sizes are overly large. We also propose a test of the validity of the estimated demographic expansion scenario, whose proper behavior is veriﬁed by simulation. We illustrate our method with human mitochondrial DNA, where estimates of expansion times are found to be 10–20\% larger when taking into account heterogeneity of mutation rates than under the inﬁnite-sites model.},

The heterozygosity excess persists only a certain number of generations until a new equilibrium is established. Two statistical tests for detecting a heterozygosity excess are described. They require measurements of the number of alleles and heterozygosity at each of several loci from a population sample. The first test determines if the proportion of loci with heterozygosity excess is significantly larger than expected at equilibrium. The second test establishes if the average of standardized differences between observed and expected heterozygosities is significantly different from zero. Type I and II errors have been evaluated by computer simulations, varying sample size, number of loci, bottleneck size, time elapsed since the beginning of the bottleneck and level of variability of loci. These analyses show that the most useful markers for bottleneck detection are those evolving under the infinite allele model (IAM) and they provide guidelines for selecting sample sizes of individuals and loci. The usefulness of these tests for conservation biology is discussed.},

This distortion is transient and likely to be detectable for only a few dozen generations. Consequently only recent bottlenecks are likely to be detected by tests for distortions in distributions of allele frequencies. We illustrate and evaluate a qualitative graphical method for detecting a bottleneck-induced distortion of allele frequency distributions. The simple novel method requires no information on historical population sizes or levels of genetic variation; it requires only samples of 5 to 20 polymorphic loci and approximately 30 individuals. The graphical method often differentiates between empirical datasets from bottlenecked and nonbottlenecked natural populations. Computer simulations show that the graphical method is likely (P \&gt; .80) to detect an allele frequency distortion after a bottleneck of ≤20 breeding individuals when 8 to 10 polymorphic microsatellite loci are analyzed.},

The method also estimates the posterior probability distributions of individual immigrant ancestries, population allele frequencies, population inbreeding coefficients, and other parameters of potential interest. The method is implemented in a computer program that relies on Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques to carry out the estimation of posterior probabilities. The program can be used with allozyme, microsatellite, RFLP, SNP, and other kinds of genotype data. We relax several assumptions of early methods for detecting recent immigrants, using genotype data; most significantly, we allow genotype frequencies to deviate from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium proportions within populations. The program is demonstrated by applying it to two recently published microsatellite data sets for populations of the plant species Centaurea corymbosa and the gray wolf species Canis lupus. A computer simulation study suggests that the program can provide highly accurate estimates of migration rates and individual migrant ancestries, given sufficient genetic differentiation among populations and sufficient numbers of marker loci.},

Sophisticated mathematical models have been developed that can encapsulate these problems in terms of parameters that need to be inferred.Bayesian statistical methods are well suited to help pick out the most reasonable parameter values — as well as to choose between entire models — and they provide a framework for including background information to help with this.The goal of Bayesian analysis is to compute the probability distribution of parameter values and model specifications given the data. This is called the posterior distribution.It is only with the development of high-speed computing over the past ten years that the potential of Bayesian methods has been realized. As a consequence, statistical analysis in genetics has undergone a dramatic shift.A computational method that has had most influence is Markov chain Monte Carlo, which allows parameter values to be drawn from the posterior distribution.Example areas that have used Bayesian methods include: population genetics, detecting the effects of selection, sequence analysis, SNP discovery, haplotype identification, analysis of gene expression, association mapping and linkage-disequilibrium mapping.A review of applications in these areas demonstrates the following advantages of Bayesian methods over other approaches: use of background information; the ability to include uncertainty in all parameter values; ease in making inferences about some parameters irrespective of the values of others; and lack of ad hoc calculations and approximations that are often associated with alternative statistical methods.There are still computational difficulties with Bayesian approaches. Further improvements are needed both in testing the accuracy of the computation involved and also in model checking.},

	abstract = {Coupled with rapid developments of efficient genetic markers, powerful population genetic methods were proposed to estimate migration rates (m) in natural populations in much broader spatial and temporal scales than the traditional mark-release-recapture (MRR) methods. Highly polymorphic (e.g. microsatellites) and genomic-wide (e.g. SNPs) markers provide sufficient information to assign individuals to their populations or parents of origin and thereby to estimate directly m in a way similar to MRR. Such direct estimates of current migration rates are particularly useful in understanding the ecology and microevolution of wild populations and in managing the populations in the future. In this study, I proposed and implemented, in the software MigEst, a likelihood method to use marker-based parentage assignments in jointly estimating m and candidate parent sampling proportions (x) in a subset of populations, investigated its power and accuracy using data simulated in various scenarios of population properties (e.g. the actual m, number, size and differentiation of populations) and sampling properties (e.g. the numbers of sampled parent candidates, offspring and markers), compared it with the population assignment approach implemented in the software BayesAss and demonstrated its usefulness by analysing a microsatellite data set from three natural populations of Brazilian bats. Simulations showed that MigEst provides unbiased and accurate estimates of m and performs better than BayesAss except when populations are highly differentiated with very small and ecologically insignificant migration rates. A valuable property of MigEst is that in the presence of unsampled populations, it gives good estimates of the rate of migration among sampled populations as well as of the rate of migration into each sampled population from the pooled unsampled populations.},

	abstract = {Intensive selection pressure coupled with the use of a limited number of high genetic merit sires has resulted in reduced effective population size and increased levels of inbreeding in dairy cattle populations. The increased rate of inbreeding amplifies the frequency of recessive deleterious alleles, possibly leading to inbreeding depression in economically important traits, such as disease resistance, fertility and production. To better understand the relationship of available and active breeding sires to Canadian herds, quantifying genetic relationships between these groups could prove insightful. The genetic relationship value (R-value) represents the average number of alleles identical by descent shared between an animal and a reference population and is currently estimated based on pedigree information. Furthermore, the average R-value indicates the relationship of a sire to the rest of the population. Estimating the R-value between sires and individual herds may offer a more refined tool for producers to select sires that are less related to their specific herds. The aim of this study was to quantify and characterize R-values between individual sires and individual herds within the Canadian Holstein population. To quantify R-values, a dataset comprised of 11,914 sires born between 1953 and 2020 and 584,740 active cows born between 1997 and 2022 from 5,592 herds was considered. Active cows were defined as those currently alive, on milk recording, and actively contributing to the national milk inventory. Active sires were considered those used to breed the active cows. All data were provided by Lactanet Canada and analyses were carried out on PEDIG using the par2 program for relationship estimation. Results indicate that herd-level R-values (i.e., R-values estimated using individual sires and individual herds) showed variation. The R-value of individual sires to individual herds containing active cows ranged from 0.43\% to 32.38. This result indicates that outbred sires are available to individual farmers when the population is considered at the herd level, and that the development of herd-level R-values may provide a selection tool which promotes the use of less related sires. Next steps include developing and estimating genomic R-values and comparing them with the pedigree-based R-values for the genotyped Canadian Holstein population. By better understanding of the relationship of available breeding sires to individual Canadian herds, a simple tool for producers to identify sires which are less related to their herds can be developed.},

	abstract = {Sheep infected with gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) can show weight loss, anemia, diarrhea, decrease appetite, and hypoproteinemia, which can sometimes lead to death. These signs of infection decrease productivity and cause economic losses. Economic losses can also be associated with treatment without efficacy due to GIN resistance to most anthelmintic classes. Combined approaches need to be used to reduce the reliance on anthelmintic as the only control method to GIN. The aim of this study is the identification of potential functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) responsible for alternate splicing in Rideau X Dorset crossbred sheep with different immune profiles using RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq). Animals were exposed to GIN while grazing, after that those with the greatest and least gastrointestinal tract parasite burdens were selected for liver RNA extracting. These animals can be separated into groups of high (H; n = 5) and medium (M; n = 6) innate immune responses. In addition, liver RNA was extracted for GIN-unexposed control lambs (U; n = 4). RNA-Seq analysis was performed using the CLC genomics workbench software, version 20.0.4 (CLC Bio, Aarhus, Denmark). Quality control analyses, including guanine-cytosine (GC) content, ambiguous base content, Phred score, base coverage, nucleotide contributions, and over-represented sequences parameters, were performed on fastq files. Sequence reads were aligned to the annotated Oar\_rambouillet\_v.1 (release 109) ovine reference genome. After filtering steps, mRNA isoforms with multiple (³ 2) expressed mRNA isoforms with at least one mRNA isoform differently expressed (DE) between H- and M-innate immune response and GIN-unexposed control groups (FDR \&lt; 0.05 and {\textbar}FC{\textbar} \&gt; 2) were keep. A total of 1, 75, and 58 DE mRNA isoforms were identified for M versus H, U versus M, and U versus H comparisons, respectively. Gene ontology (GO) analysis including the biological process, molecular function, and cellular component GO categories and metabolic pathways analysis were performed using STRING-db software. Enriched biological processes and metabolic pathways related to the immune system, as well as cholesterol and other sterol metabolism (e.g., sterol biosynthesis, steroid metabolism, cholesterol biosynthesis, cholesterol metabolism, ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, drug metabolism, and terpenoid biosynthesis) were identified (FDR \&lt; 0.05). Next, the list of DE mRNA isoforms identified will be deeply studied by performing SNP discovery analysis to validate if specific functional SNPs are responsible for the alternative splicing affecting GIN resistance in grazing sheep. The complete results will help to better understand the biological mechanisms that may be regulating the immune response to GIN. Candidate functional SNPs have the potential to be included in a commercial SNP panel for selection of more resistant animals to improve GIN resistance in sheep flocks.},

            Western hemisphere goats have European, African and Central Asian origins, and some local or rare breeds are reported to be adapted to their environments and economically important.

Using 50 K SNP genotypes of 244 animals from 12 goat populations in United States, Costa Rica, Brazil and Argentina, we evaluated the genetic diversity, population structure and selective sweeps documenting goat migration to the “New World”. Our findings suggest the concept of breed, particularly among “locally adapted” breeds, is not a meaningful way to characterize goat populations. The USA Spanish goats were found to be an important genetic reservoir, sharing genomic composition with the wild ancestor and with specialized breeds (e.g. Angora, Lamancha and Saanen). Results suggest goats in the Americas have substantial genetic diversity to use in selection and promote environmental adaptation or product driven specialization. These findings highlight the importance of maintaining goat conservation programs and suggest an awaiting reservoir of genetic diversity for breeding and research while simultaneously discarding concerns about breed designations.},

	abstract = {Background
Basic understanding of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and population structure, as well as the consistency of gametic phase across breeds is crucial for genome-wide association studies and successful implementation of genomic selection. However, it is still limited in goats. Therefore, the objectives of this research were: (i) to estimate genome-wide levels of LD in goat breeds using data generated with the Illumina Goat SNP50 BeadChip; (ii) to study the consistency of gametic phase across breeds in order to evaluate the possible use of a multi-breed training population for genomic selection and (iii) develop insights concerning the population history of goat breeds.

Results
Average r2 between adjacent SNP pairs ranged from 0.28 to 0.11 for Boer and Rangeland populations. At the average distance between adjacent SNPs in the current 50 k SNP panel ({\textasciitilde}0.06 Mb), the breeds LaMancha, Nubian, Toggenburg and Boer exceeded or approached the level of linkage disequilibrium that is useful (r2 {\textgreater} 0.2) for genomic predictions. In all breeds LD decayed rapidly with increasing inter-marker distance. The estimated correlations for all the breed pairs, except Canadian and Australian Boer populations, were lower than 0.70 for all marker distances greater than 0.02 Mb. These results are not high enough to encourage the pooling of breeds in a single training population for genomic selection. The admixture analysis shows that some breeds have distinct genotypes based on SNP50 genotypes, such as the Boer, Cashmere and Nubian populations. The other groups share higher genome proportions with each other, indicating higher admixture and a more diverse genetic composition.

Conclusions
This work presents results of a diverse collection of breeds, which are of great interest for the implementation of genomic selection in goats. The LD results indicate that, with a large enough training population, genomic selection could potentially be implemented within breed with the current 50 k panel, but some breeds might benefit from a denser panel. For multi-breed genomic evaluation, a denser SNP panel also seems to be required.

	abstract = {The dairy goat is one of the earliest dairy livestock species, which plays an important role in the economic development, especially for developing countries. With the development of agricultural civilization, dairy goats have been widely distributed across the world. However, few studies have been conducted on the specific characteristics of dairy goat. In this study, we collected the whole-genome data of 89 goat individuals by sequencing 48 goats and employing 41 publicly available goats, including five dairy goat breeds (Saanen, Nubian, Alpine, Toggenburg, and Guanzhong dairy goat; n = 24, 15, 11, 6, 6), and three goat breeds (Guishan goat, Longlin goat, Yunshang Black goat; n = 6, 15, 6). Through compared the genomes of dairy goat and non-dairy goat to analyze genetic diversity and selection characteristics of dairy goat. The results show that the eight goats could be divided into three subgroups of European, African, and Chinese indigenous goat populations, and we also found that Australian Nubian, Toggenburg, and Australian Alpine had the highest linkage disequilibrium, the lowest level of nucleotide diversity, and a higher inbreeding coefficient, indicating that they were strongly artificially selected. In addition, we identified several candidate genes related to the specificity of dairy goat, particularly genes associated with milk production traits (GHR, DGAT2, ELF5, GLYCAM1, ACSBG2, ACSS2), reproduction traits (TSHR, TSHB, PTGS2, ESR2), immunity traits (JAK1, POU2F2, LRRC66). Our results provide not only insights into the evolutionary history and breed characteristics of dairy goat, but also valuable information for the implementation and improvement of dairy goat cross breeding program.},

	abstract = {Specific local environmental and sociocultural conditions have led to the creation of various goat populations in Russia. National goat diversity includes breeds that have been selected for down and mohair production traits as well as versatile local breeds for which pastoralism is the main management system. Effective preservation and breeding programs for local goat breeds are missing due to the lack of DNA-based data. In this work, we analyzed the genetic diversity and population structure of Russian local goats, including Altai Mountain, Altai White Downy, Dagestan Downy, Dagestan Local, Karachaev, Orenburg, and Soviet Mohair goats, which were genotyped with the Illumina Goat SNP50 BeadChip. In addition, we addressed genetic relationships between local and global goat populations obtained from the AdaptMap project. Russian goats showed a high level of genetic diversity. Although a decrease in historical effective population sizes was revealed, the recent effective population sizes estimated for three generations ago were larger than 100 in all studied populations. The mean runs of homozygosity (ROH) lengths ranged from 79.42 to 183.94 Mb, and the average ROH number varied from 18 to 41. Short ROH segments ({\textless}2 Mb) were predominant in all breeds, while the longest ROH class ({\textgreater}16 Mb) was the least frequent. Principal component analysis, Neighbor-Net graph, and Admixture clustering revealed several patterns in Russian local goats. First, a separation of the Karachaev breed from other populations was observed. Moreover, genetic connections between the Orenburg and Altai Mountain breeds were suggested and the Dagestan breeds were found to be admixed with the Soviet Mohair breed. Neighbor-Net analysis and clustering of local and global breeds demonstrated the close genetic relations between Russian local and Turkish breeds that probably resulted from past admixture events through postdomestication routes. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the genetic relationships of goats originating in West Asia and Eurasia and may be used to design breeding programs for local goats to ensure their effective conservation and proper management.},

	abstract = {In goat breeds, the domestication followed by artificial selection for economically important traits have shaped genetic variation within populations, leading to the fixation of specific alleles for specific traits. This led to the formation and evolution of many different breeds specialised and raised for a particular purpose. However, and despite the intensity of artificial selection, natural selection continues acting, possibly leaving a more diluted contribution over time, whose traces may be more difficult to capture. In order to explore selection footprints as response of environmental adaptation, we analysed a total of 993 goats from four transboundary goats breeds (Angora, Boer, Nubian and Saanen) genotyped with the SNP chip 50 K using outlier detection, runs of homozygosity and haplotype-based detection methods. Our results showed that all methods identified footprints on chromosome 6 (from 30 to 49 Mb) for two specific populations of Nubian goats sampled in Egypt. In Angora and Saanen breeds, we detected two selective sweeps using HapFLK, on chromosome 21 (from 52 to 55 Mb) and chromosome 25 (from 1 to 5 Mb) respectively. The analysis of runs of homozygosity showed some hotspots in all breeds. The overall investigation of the selected regions detected combining the different approaches and the gene ontology exploration revealed both novel and well-known loci related to adaptation, especially for heat stress. Our findings can help to better understand the balance between the two selective pressures in commercial goat breeds providing new insights on the molecular mechanisms of adaptation.},

Primary goals are QTL detection and genomic selection. The purpose here was design of a 50–60,000 SNP chip for goats. The success of a moderate density SNP assay depends on reliable bioinformatic SNP detection procedures, the technological success rate of the SNP design, even spacing of SNPs on the genome and selection of Minor Allele Frequencies (MAF) suitable to use in diverse breeds. Through the federation of three SNP discovery projects consolidated as the International Goat Genome Consortium, we have identified approximately twelve million high quality SNP variants in the goat genome stored in a database together with their biological and technical characteristics. These SNPs were identified within and between six breeds (meat, milk and mixed): Alpine, Boer, Creole, Katjang, Saanen and Savanna, comprising a total of 97 animals. Whole genome and Reduced Representation Library sequences were aligned on {\textgreater}10 kb scaffolds of the de novo goat genome assembly. The 60,000 selected SNPs, evenly spaced on the goat genome, were submitted for oligo manufacturing (Illumina, Inc) and published in dbSNP along with flanking sequences and map position on goat assemblies (i.e. scaffolds and pseudo-chromosomes), sheep genome V2 and cattle UMD3.1 assembly. Ten breeds were then used to validate the SNP content and 52,295 loci could be successfully genotyped and used to generate a final cluster file. The combined strategy of using mainly whole genome Next Generation Sequencing and mapping on a contig genome assembly, complemented with Illumina design tools proved to be efficient in producing this GoatSNP50 chip. Advances in use of molecular markers are expected to accelerate goat genomic studies in coming years.},

Combining phenotypic, pedigree, and genomic data from genetically related populations can be a feasible strategy to overcome this limitation. However, the success of across-population genetic evaluations depends on the pedigree connectedness and genetic relationship among individuals from different populations. In this context, this study aimed to evaluate the genetic connectedness and population structure of Alpine and Saanen dairy goats from four countries involved in the European project SMARTER (SMAll RuminanTs Breeding for Efficiency and Resilience), including Canada, France, Italy, and Switzerland. These analyses are paramount for assessing the potential feasibility of an across-country genomic evaluation in dairy goats. Approximately, 9,855 genotyped individuals (with 51\% French genotyped animals) and 6,435,189 animals included in the pedigree files were available across all four populations. The pedigree analyses indicated that the exchange of breeding animals was mainly unilateral with flows from France to the other three countries. Italy has also imported breeding animals from Switzerland. Principal component analyses (PCAs), genetic admixture analysis, and consistency of the gametic phase revealed that French and Italian populations are more genetically related than the other dairy goat population pairs. Canadian dairy goats showed the largest within-breed heterogeneity and genetic differences with the European populations. The genetic diversity and population connectedness between the studied populations indicated that an international genomic evaluation may be more feasible, especially for French and Italian goats. Further studies will investigate the accuracy of genomic breeding values when combining the datasets from these four populations.},

Analyses carried out included individual‐based approaches (principal component analysis and population structure) and population‐based approaches (phylogenetic tree constructions). The results of the genetic diversity analyses revealed that French breeds are clearly differentiated, in particular, the Angora breed that originates from south west Asia. The Provençale breed shows a very original genetic pattern that could be the result of ancient admixture. Then, selection signatures were detected by identifying regions of outlying genetic differentiation between populations. Five genomic regions were detected under selection on chromosomes 5, 6, 11, 13 and 20, revealing mainly soft selective sweeps and a few hard selective sweeps and highlighting candidate genes that had been selected for during the evolutionary history of these breeds.

	abstract = {Background
The detection of signatures of selection has the potential to elucidate the identities of genes and mutations associated with phenotypic traits important for livestock species. It is also very relevant to investigate the levels of genetic diversity of a population, as genetic diversity represents the raw material essential for breeding and has practical implications for implementation of genomic selection. A total of 1151 animals from nine goat populations selected for different breeding goals and genotyped with the Illumina Goat 50K single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) Beadchip were included in this investigation.

Results
The proportion of polymorphic SNPs ranged from 0.902 (Nubian) to 0.995 (Rangeland). The overall mean HO and HE was 0.374 ± 0.021 and 0.369 ± 0.023, respectively. The average pairwise genetic distance (D) ranged from 0.263 (Toggenburg) to 0.323 (Rangeland). The overall average for the inbreeding measures FEH, FVR, FLEUT, FROH and FPED was 0.129, −0.012, −0.010, 0.038 and 0.030, respectively. Several regions located on 19 chromosomes were potentially under selection in at least one of the goat breeds. The genomic population tree constructed using all SNPs differentiated breeds based on selection purpose, while genomic population tree built using only SNPs in the most significant region showed a great differentiation between LaMancha and the other breeds. We hypothesized that this region is related to ear morphogenesis. Furthermore, we identified genes potentially related to reproduction traits, adult body mass, efficiency of food conversion, abdominal fat deposition, conformation traits, liver fat metabolism, milk fatty acids, somatic cells score, milk protein, thermo-tolerance and ear morphogenesis.

Conclusions
In general, moderate to high levels of genetic variability were observed for all the breeds and a characterization of runs of homozygosity gave insights into the breeds’ development history. The information reported here will be useful for the implementation of genomic selection and other genomic studies in goats. We also identified various genome regions under positive selection using smoothed FST and hapFLK statistics and suggested genes, which are potentially under selection. These results can now provide a foundation to formulate biological hypotheses related to selection processes in goats.

	abstract = {Background
The domestication of wild goats and subsequent intensive trait-driven crossing, inbreeding, and selection have led to dramatic phenotypic purification and intermediate breeds for the high-quality production of dairy, cashmere wool, and meat. Genomic resequencing provides a powerful means for the direct identification of trait-associated sequence variations that underlie molecular mechanisms of domestication.

Results
Here, we report our effort to define such variations based on data from domestic goat breeds (Capra aegagrus hircus; five each) selected for dairy, cashmere, and meat production in reference to their wild ancestors, the Sindh ibex (Capra aegagrus blythi; two) and the Markhor (Capra falconeri; two). Using ∼24 million high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), ∼1.9 million insertions/deletions, and 2,317 copy number variations, we define SNP-desert-associated genes (SAGs), domestic-associated genes (DAGs), and trait-associated genes (TAGs) and attempt to associate them with quantitative trait loci (QTL), domestication, and agronomic traits. A greater majority of SAGs shared by all domestic breeds are classified into Gene Ontology categories of metabolism and cell cycle. DAGs, together with some SAGs, are most relevant to behavior, immunity, and trait specificity. Whereas, TAGs such as growth differentiation factor 5 and fibroblast growth factor 5 for bone and hair growth, respectively, appear to be directly involved in growth regulation.

Conclusions
When investigating the divergence of Capra populations, the sequence variations and candidate function-associated genes we have identified provide valuable molecular markers for trait-driven genetic mapping and breeding.},

Goat breeds in Kenya have evolved for survival, breeding, and production in various harsh ecological areas, and their genomes are likely to have acquired unique alleles for adaptation to such diverse production environments and other traits of economic importance. To investigate signals of selection for some selected goat breeds in Kenya, Alpine (n = 29), Galla (n = 12), Saanen (n = 24), and Toggenburg (n = 31) were considered. A total of 53,347 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) generated using the Illumina GoatSNP50 BeadChip were analyzed. After quality control, 47,663 autosomal single-nucleotide polymorphisms remained for downstream analyses. Several complementary approaches were applied for the following analyses: integrated Haplotype Score (iHS), cross-population-extended haplotype homozygosity (XP-EHH), hapFLK, and FLK. A total of 404 top genomic regions were identified across all the four breeds, based on the four complementary analyses. Out of the 16 identified putative selection signature regions by the intersection of multiple-selective signal analyses, most of the putative regions were found to overlap significantly with the iHS and XP-EHH analyses on chromosomes 3, 4, 10, 15, 22, and 26. These regions were enriched with some genes involved in pathways associated directly or indirectly with environmental adaptation regulating immune responses (e.g., HYAL1 and HYAL3), milk production (e.g., LEPR and PDE4B), and adaptability (e.g., MST1 and PCK). The results revealed few intersect between breeds in genomic selection signature regions. In general, this did not present the typical classic selection signatures as predicted due to the complex nature of the traits. The results support that some various selection pressures (e.g., environmental challenges, artificial selection, and genome admixture challenges) have molded the genome of goat breeds in Kenya. Therefore, the research provides new knowledge on the conservation and utilization of these goat genetic resources in Kenya. In-depth research is needed to detect precise genes connected with adaptation and production in goat breeds in Kenya.},

	abstract = {Indigenous breeds develop their own genomic characteristics by adapting to local environments or cultures over long periods of time. Most of them are not particularly productive in commercial terms, but they have abilities to survive in harsh environments or tolerate to specific diseases. Their adaptive characteristics play an important role as genetic materials for improving commercial breeds. As a step toward this goal, we analyzed the genome of Korean indigenous goats within 10 goat breeds. We collected 136 goat individuals by sequencing 46 new goats and employing 90 publicly available goats. Our whole-genome data was comprised of three indigenous breeds (Korean indigenous goat, Iranian indigenous goat, and Moroccan indigenous goat; n = 29, 18, 20), six commercial breeds (Saanen, Boer, Anglo-Nubian, British Alpine, Alpine, and Korean crossbred; n = 16, 11, 5, 5, 2, 13), and their ancestral species (Capra aegagrus; n = 17). We identified that the Iranian indigenous goat and the Moroccan indigenous goat have relatively similar genomic characteristics within a large category of genomic diversity but found that the Korean indigenous goat has unique genomic characteristics distinguished from the other nine breeds. Through population analysis, we confirmed that these characteristics have resulted from a near-isolated environment with strong genetic drift. The Korean indigenous goat experienced a severe genetic bottleneck upon entering the Korean Peninsula about 2,000 years ago, and has subsequently rarely experienced genetic interactions with other goat breeds. From selection analysis and gene-set enrichment analysis, we revealed selection signals for Salmonella infection and cardiomyopathy in the genome of the Korean indigenous goat. These adaptive characteristics were further identified with genomic-based evidence. We uncovered genomic regions of selective sweeps in the LBP and BPI genes (Salmonella infection) and the TTN and ITGB6 genes (cardiomyopathy), among several candidate genes. Our research presents unique genomic characteristics and distinctive selection signals of the Korean indigenous goat based on the extensive comparison. Although the adaptive traits require further validation through biological experiments, our findings are expected to provide a direction for future biodiversity conservation strategies and to contribute another option to genomic-based breeding programmes for improving the viability of Capra hircus.},

Moreover, we present a panel of candidate markers acquired using different genetic models for breed discrimination. Quality control on the initial dataset resulted in 48,841 SNPs kept for downstream analysis. Principal component and admixture analyses were applied to assess population structure. The rate of inbreeding within breed was evaluated based on the distribution of runs of homozygosity in the genome and respective coefficients, the genomic relationship matrix, the patterns of linkage disequilibrium, and the historic effective population size. Results showed that both breeds exhibit high levels of genetic diversity. Level of inbreeding between the two breeds estimated by the Wright’s fixation index FST was low (Fst = 0.04362), indicating the existence of a weak genetic differentiation between them. In addition, grouping of farms according to their geographical locations was observed.

	abstract = {Background
Among the European countries, Italy counts the largest number of local goat breeds. Thanks to the recent availability of a medium-density SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) chip for goat, the genetic diversity of Italian goat populations was characterized by genotyping samples from 14 Italian goat breeds that originate from different geographical areas with more than 50 000 SNPs evenly distributed on the genome.

Results
Analysis of the genotyping data revealed high levels of genetic polymorphism and an underlying North–south geographic pattern of genetic diversity that was highlighted by both the first dimension of the multi-dimensional scaling plot and the Neighbour network reconstruction. We observed a moderate and weak population structure in Northern and Central-Southern breeds, respectively, with pairwise FST values between breeds ranging from 0.013 to 0.164 and 7.49 \% of the total variance assigned to the between-breed level. Only 2.11 \% of the variance explained the clustering of breeds into geographical groups (Northern, Central and Southern Italy and Islands).

Conclusions
Our results indicate that the present-day genetic diversity of Italian goat populations was shaped by the combined effects of drift, presence or lack of gene flow and, to some extent, by the consequences of traditional management systems and recent demographic history. Our findings may constitute the starting point for the development of marker-assisted approaches, to better address future breeding and management policies in a species that is particularly relevant for the medium- and long-term sustainability of marginal regions.

	abstract = {Background
Goat populations that are characterized within the AdaptMap project cover a large part of the worldwide distribution of this species and provide the opportunity to assess their diversity at a global scale. We analysed genome-wide 50 K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from 144 populations to describe the global patterns of molecular variation, compare them to those observed in other livestock species, and identify the drivers that led to the current distribution of goats.

Results
A high degree of genetic variability exists among the goat populations studied. Our results highlight a strong partitioning of molecular diversity between and within continents. Three major gene pools correspond to goats from Europe, Africa and West Asia. Dissection of sub-structures disclosed regional gene pools, which reflect the main post-domestication migration routes. We also identified several exchanges, mainly in African populations, and which often involve admixed and cosmopolitan breeds. Extensive gene flow has taken place within specific areas (e.g., south Europe, Morocco and Mali-Burkina Faso-Nigeria), whereas elsewhere isolation due to geographical barriers (e.g., seas or mountains) or human management has decreased local gene flows.

Conclusions
After domestication in the Fertile Crescent in the early Neolithic era (ca. 12,000 YBP), domestic goats that already carried differentiated gene pools spread to Europe, Africa and Asia. The spread of these populations determined the major genomic background of the continental populations, which currently have a more marked subdivision than that observed in other ruminant livestock species. Subsequently, further diversification occurred at the regional level due to geographical and reproductive isolation, which was accompanied by additional migrations and/or importations, the traces of which are still detectable today. The effects of breed formation were clearly detected, particularly in Central and North Europe. Overall, our results highlight a remarkable diversity that occurs at the global scale and is locally partitioned and often affected by introgression from cosmopolitan breeds. These findings support the importance of long-term preservation of goat diversity, and provide a useful framework for investigating adaptive introgression, directing genetic improvement and choosing breeding targets.

	doi = {10.1186/s12711-018-0424-8},
	abstract = {Background
Patterns of homozygosity can be influenced by several factors, such as demography, recombination, and selection. Using the goat SNP50 BeadChip, we genotyped 3171 goats belonging to 117 populations with a worldwide distribution. Our objectives were to characterize the number and length of runs of homozygosity (ROH) and to detect ROH hotspots in order to gain new insights into the consequences of neutral and selection processes on the genome-wide homozygosity patterns of goats.

Results
The proportion of the goat genome covered by ROH is, in general, less than 15\% with an inverse relationship between ROH length and frequency i.e. short ROH ({\textless} 3 Mb) are the most frequent ones. Our data also indicate that {\textasciitilde} 60\% of the breeds display low FROH coefficients ({\textless} 0.10), while {\textasciitilde} 30 and {\textasciitilde} 10\% of the goat populations show moderate (0.10 {\textless} FROH {\textless} 0.20) or high ({\textgreater} 0.20) FROH values. For populations from Asia, the average number of ROH is smaller and their coverage is lower in goats from the Near East than in goats from Central Asia, which is consistent with the role of the Fertile Crescent as the primary centre of goat domestication. We also observed that local breeds with small population sizes tend to have a larger fraction of the genome covered by ROH compared to breeds with tens or hundreds of thousands of individuals. Five regions on three goat chromosomes i.e. 11, 12 and 18, contain ROH hotspots that overlap with signatures of selection.

Conclusions
Patterns of homozygosity (average number of ROH of 77 and genome coverage of 248 Mb; FROH {\textless} 0.15) are similar in goats from different geographic areas. The increased homozygosity in local breeds is the consequence of their small population size and geographic isolation as well as of founder effects and recent inbreeding. The existence of three ROH hotspots that co-localize with signatures of selection demonstrates that selection has also played an important role in increasing the homozygosity of specific regions in the goat genome. Finally, most of the goat breeds analysed in this work display low levels of homozygosity, which is favourable for their genetic management and viability.

We performed SNP genotyping of indigenous goats of Mongolia to explore their demographic history in the global context and to estimate their genetic risks. Recently, these risks have become a subject of concern due to recent climatic disasters and uncontrolled massive breeding. Various clustering methods demonstrated close genetic relations among Mongolian, Russian, Chinese, and West Asian breeds. Mongolian goats themselves exhibited low to moderate estimates of genetic differentiation. We identified genetic features highlighting the distinct origin and breeding history of Mongolian goat breeds, as well as traces of artificial selection and geographic isolation. However, none of them met formal criteria to be considered as endangered.

Abstract
Mongolian goats are of great interest for studying ancient migration routes and domestication, and also represent a good model of adaptability to harsh environments. Recent climatic disasters and uncontrolled massive breeding endangered the valuable genetic resources of Mongolian goats and raised the question of their conservation status. Meanwhile, Mongolian goats have never been studied on genomic scale. We used Illumina Goat SNP50 to estimate genetic risks in five Mongolian goat breeds (Buural, Ulgii Red, Gobi GS, Erchim, Dorgon) and explored phylogenic relationships among these populations and in the context of other breeds. Various clustering methods showed that Mongolian goats grouped with other Asian breeds and were especially close to some neighboring Russian and Chinese breeds. The Buural breed showed the lowest estimates of inbreeding and exhibited the shortest genetic distances within the other Mongolian breeds, especially, to Ulgii Red and Gobi GS. These three breeds formed a single core group, being weakly differentiated from each other. Among them, Gobi GS displayed obvious signs of inbreeding probably resulted from artificial selection pressure. Dorgon and especially Erchim goats stand apart from the other Mongolian breeds according to various types of analyses, and bear unique features pointing to different breeding histories or distinct origins of these breeds. All populations showed strong decline in effective population size. However, none of them met formal criteria to be considered as endangered breeds. The SNP data obtained in this study improved the knowledge of Mongolian goat breeds and could be used in future management decisions in order to preserve their genetic diversity.},

Neolithic, approximately 10,500 years ago, and humans exerted minor selection

over the millennia happened via natural selection and random genetic drift, the
latter causing genes to be fixed in small and isolated populations. Recent
human-influenced genetic changes have occurred through biometrics and genomics.
For the most part, biometrics has concentrated upon the refining of estimates of
heritabilities and genetic correlations. Heritabilities are instrumental in the
calculation of estimated breeding values and genetic correlations are necessary
in the construction of selection indices that account for changes in multiple
traits under selection at one time. Early genomic studies focused upon
microsatellite markers, which are short tandem repeats of nucleic acids and
which are detected using polymerase chain reaction primers flanking the
microsatellite. Microsatellite markers have been very important in parentage
verification, which can impact genetic progress. Additionally, microsatellite
markers have been a useful tool in assessing genetic diversity between and among
breeds, which is important in the conservation of minor breeds. Single
nucleotide polymorphisms are a new genomic tool that have refined classical BLUP
methodology (biometric) to provide more accurate genomic estimated breeding
values, provided a large reference population is available.},

There is paucity of literature on GWAS for economically important traits i.e., body weight and morphometric measurements. Therefore, we performed GWAS using 50 K SNP Chip for growth in term of age adjusted body weight and morphometric measurements in order to identify genomic regions influencing these traits among Punjab goat breeds. Blood samples were collected from 879 unrelated animals of seven goat breeds along with data for body weight and morphometric measurements including body length, body height, pubic bone length, heart girth and chest length. Genomic DNA was extracted and genotyped using 50 K SNP bead chip. Association of genotypic data with the phenotypic data was performed using Plink 1.9 software. Linear mixed model was used for the association study. Genes were annotated from Capra hircus genome using assembly ARS1. We have identified a number of highly significant SNPs and respective candidate genes associated with growth and body conformation traits. The functional aspects of these candidate genes suggested their potential role in body growth. Moreover, pleiotropic effects were observed for some SNPs for body weight and conformation traits.

Inbreeding is generally expected to have a stronger unfavorable effect on fitness traits than on other traits. Traditionally, the degree of inbreeding depression in livestock has been estimated as the slope of the linear regression of phenotypic values on pedigree-based inbreeding coefficients. With the increasing availability of SNP-data, pedigree inbreeding can now be replaced by SNP-based measures. We performed a meta-analysis of 154 studies, published from 1990 to 2020 on seven livestock species, and compared the degree of inbreeding depression (1) across different trait groups, and (2) across different pedigree-based and SNP-based measures of inbreeding. Across all studies and traits, a 1\% increase in pedigree inbreeding was associated with a median decrease in phenotypic value of 0.13\% of a trait’s mean, or 0.59\% of a trait’s standard deviation. Inbreeding had an unfavorable effect on all sorts of traits and there was no evidence for a stronger effect on primary fitness traits (e.g., reproduction/survival traits) than on other traits (e.g., production traits or morphological traits). p-values of inbreeding depression estimates were smaller for SNP-based inbreeding measures than for pedigree inbreeding, suggesting more power for SNP-based measures. There were no consistent differences in p-values for percentage of homozygous SNPs, inbreeding based on runs of homozygosity (ROH) or inbreeding based on a genomic relationship matrix. The number of studies that directly compares these different measures, however, is limited and comparisons are furthermore complicated by differences in scale and arbitrary definitions of particularly ROH-based inbreeding. To facilitate comparisons across studies in future, we provide the dataset with inbreeding depression estimates of 154 studies and stress the importance of always reporting detailed information (on traits, inbreeding coefficients, and models used) along with inbreeding depression estimates.},

We investigated the diversity of CNV distribution in goats using CaprineSNP50 genotyping data generated by the ADAPTmap Project.

These CNVs were merged into 978 CNV regions, spanning {\textasciitilde}262 Mb of total length and corresponding to {\textasciitilde}8.96\% of the goat genome.

The results of a cluster heatmap analysis based on the CNV count per individual across different groups was generally consistent with the one generated from the SNP data, likely reflecting the population history of different goat breeds. We sought to determine the gene content of these CNV events and found several important CNV-overlapping genes (e.g. EDNRA, ADAMTS20, ASIP, KDM5B, ADAM8, DGAT1, CHRNB1, CLCN7, and EXOSC4), which are involved in local adaptations such as coat color, muscle development, metabolic processes, osteopetrosis, and embryonic development.

	abstract = {Background
Since goat was domesticated 10,000 years ago, many factors have contributed to the differentiation of goat breeds and these are classified mainly into two types: (i) adaptation to different breeding systems and/or purposes and (ii) adaptation to different environments. As a result, approximately 600 goat breeds have developed worldwide; they differ considerably from one another in terms of phenotypic characteristics and are adapted to a wide range of climatic conditions. In this work, we analyzed the AdaptMap goat dataset, which is composed of data from more than 3000 animals collected worldwide and genotyped with the CaprineSNP50 BeadChip. These animals were partitioned into groups based on geographical area, production uses, available records on solid coat color and environmental variables including the sampling geographical coordinates, to investigate the role of natural and/or artificial selection in shaping the genome of goat breeds.

Results
Several signatures of selection on different chromosomal regions were detected across the different breeds, sub-geographical clusters, phenotypic and climatic groups. These regions contain genes that are involved in important biological processes, such as milk-, meat- or fiber-related production, coat color, glucose pathway, oxidative stress response, size, and circadian clock differences. Our results confirm previous findings in other species on adaptation to extreme environments and human purposes and provide new genes that could explain some of the differences between goat breeds according to their geographical distribution and adaptation to different environments.

Conclusions
These analyses of signatures of selection provide a comprehensive first picture of the global domestication process and adaptation of goat breeds and highlight possible genes that may have contributed to the differentiation of this species worldwide.

	abstract = {Principal component analysis of a data matrix extracts the dominant patterns in the matrix in terms of a complementary set of score and loading plots. It is the responsibility of the data analyst to formulate the scientific issue at hand in terms of PC projections, PLS regressions, etc. Ask yourself, or the investigator, why the data matrix was collected, and for what purpose the experiments and measurements were made. Specify before the analysis what kinds of patterns you would expect and what you would find exciting. The results of the analysis depend on the scaling of the matrix, which therefore must be specified. Variance scaling, where each variable is scaled to unit variance, can be recommended for general use, provided that almost constant variables are left unscaled. Combining different types of variables warrants blockscaling. In the initial analysis, look for outliers and strong groupings in the plots, indicating that the data matrix perhaps should be “polished” or whether disjoint modeling is the proper course. For plotting purposes, two or three principal components are usually sufficient, but for modeling purposes the number of significant components should be properly determined, e.g. by cross-validation. Use the resulting principal components to guide your continued investigation or chemical experimentation, not as an end in itself.},

The first alternative is called discriminative validity, that is, the people construct should not be highly correlated to variables that our indicator does not claim to measure. The second alternative is for convergent validity, that is, the correlation of the author measure of interest with the measures of others. In addition, the authors present some ways to operationalize the concepts through indexes that can show the people the measurement variability among different analysis units, in order to compare them or include them within a more complex analysis. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique helps the people define which combination of data best represents the concept the people want to measure. PCA technique gives the people different components, which are the reduction of the dimensionality of a multivariate dataset condensing the dimensions into one single variable.},

To that end, 86 Marota and 10 Anglo-Nubian animals were genotyped. Genetic diversity was analysed by comparing minor allele frequency (MAF) in the herds. Population structure and genetic differentiation were evaluated using a Bayesian approach, principal component analysis (PCA) and the fixation index (FST). High genetic differentiation (FST = 0.16) was seen in the Marota population in relation to the Anglo-Nubian. The private herd shared a greater number of fixed SNPs with the herd of Anglo-Nubians (1024) than did the conservation herd (741). The results of the PCA, together with those from the analysis carried out using the Structure software, showed the presence of Anglo-Nubian genes in the Marota herds. It can therefore be concluded that the high level of polymorphism and high genetic differentiation between Marota and Anglo-Nubian goats characterise these animals as a source of genetic diversity for goat farming in the region; the Illumina 50 K goat SNP Chip is efficient in population structure analysis in Marota goats; microarray technology, analysis using the Structure software, and Principal Component Analysis complement each other in expanding the ability to detect gene introgression in small populations; there is evidence of the introgression of Anglo-Nubian genes in the herds of Marota goats under analysis.},

	abstract = {The knowledge about linkage disequilibrium (LD) and effective population size (Ne) is essential to determine the optimal marker density required for performing genomic studies. In this study, the aim was to estimate the LD and Ne of a Saanen goat population using a panel of 62,557 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), Axiom\_OviCap (Caprine), customized by Affimetrix. Twenty-four males and 916 females were genotyped from herds from the Dairy Goats Breeding Program (from Portuguese Programa de Melhoramento Genético de Caprinos Leiteiros - Capragene®). The decay of the LD was analysed using quadratic correlation coefficient (r2) for all pairs of markers on each chromosome. To estimate Ne the values of r2 combined with the distance between the markers was used, based on the physical map used for the LD analysis. The mean value of r2 between adjacent markers (∼52 kb) was 0.04 ± 0.06. Among chromosomes, the range of values varied from 0.03 ± 0.06 to 0.05 ± 0.08. The LD fell rapidly from the first to the second distance range. In later intervals, the average of r2 decreased more gradually. Moderate levels of r2 ({\textgreater} 0.20), on a scale of 0–1, were observed only in the genetic distance classes up to 20 kb. The estimate of Ne decreased over time, ranging from 42 animals, 19 past generations, to 15 animals in the current generation. The observed results have practical applications for performing genomic studies, and indicate the need to use a denser marker panel (∼ 300k), since the LD level was relatively small even at short distances, and it is essential to expand the size of the reference population.},

	abstract = {The dairy goat is one of the earliest dairy livestock species, which plays an important role in the economic development, especially for developing countries. With the development of agricultural civilization, dairy goats have been widely distributed across the world. However, few studies have been conducted on the specific characteristics of dairy goat. In this study, we collected the whole-genome data of 89 goat individuals by sequencing 48 goats and employing 41 publicly available goats, including five dairy goat breeds (Saanen, Nubian, Alpine, Toggenburg, and Guanzhong dairy goat; n = 24, 15, 11, 6, 6), and three goat breeds (Guishan goat, Longlin goat, Yunshang Black goat; n = 6, 15, 6). Through compared the genomes of dairy goat and non-dairy goat to analyze genetic diversity and selection characteristics of dairy goat. The results show that the eight goats could be divided into three subgroups of European, African, and Chinese indigenous goat populations, and we also found that Australian Nubian, Toggenburg, and Australian Alpine had the highest linkage disequilibrium, the lowest level of nucleotide diversity, and a higher inbreeding coefficient, indicating that they were strongly artificially selected. In addition, we identified several candidate genes related to the specificity of dairy goat, particularly genes associated with milk production traits (GHR, DGAT2, ELF5, GLYCAM1, ACSBG2, ACSS2), reproduction traits (TSHR, TSHB, PTGS2, ESR2), immunity traits (JAK1, POU2F2, LRRC66). Our results provide not only insights into the evolutionary history and breed characteristics of dairy goat, but also valuable information for the implementation and improvement of dairy goat cross breeding program.},

Nine hundred forty goats, genotyped with an Axiom\_OviCap (Caprine) panel, Affimetrix customized array with 62,557 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), were used for the genomic selection analyses. The genomic methods studied to estimate the effects of SNPs and direct genomic values (DGV) were as follows: (a) genomic BLUP (GBLUP), (b) Bayes Cπ and (c) Bayesian Lasso (BLASSO). Estimated breeding values (EBV) and deregressed estimated breeding values (dEBV) were used as response variables for the genomic predictions. The prediction ability was assessed by Pearson's correlation between DGV and response variables (EBV and dEBV). Regression coefficients of the response variables on the DGV were obtained to verify if the genomic predictions were biased. In addition, the mean square error of prediction (MSE) was used as a measure of verification of model fit to the data. The means of prediction accuracy, when EBV was used as a response variable, were 0.68, 0.68 and 0.67 for GBLUP, Bayes Cπ and BLASSO, respectively. With dEBV, the mean prediction accuracy was 0.50 for all models. The averages of the EBV regression coefficients on DGV were 1.08 for all models (GBLUP, Bayes Cπ and BLASSO), higher than those obtained for the regression coefficient of dEBV on DGV, which presented values of 1.05, 1.05 and 1.08 for GBLUP, Bayes Cπ and BLASSO, respectively. None of the methods stood out in terms of prediction ability; however, the GBLUP method was the most appropriate for estimating the DGV, in a slightly more reliable and less biased way, besides presenting the lowest computational cost. In the context of the present study, EBV was the preferred response variables considering the genomic prediction accuracy despite dEBV also presented lower bias.},

	abstract = {Genome association studies (GWAS) provides knowledge about the genetic architecture of beef-related traits that allow linking the target phenotype to genomic information aiding breeding decision. Thus, the present study aims to uncover the genetic mechanism involved in carcass (REA: rib eye area, BF: backfat thickness, and HCW: hot carcass weight) and meat quality traits (SF: shear-force, MARB: marbling score, and IMF: intramuscular fat content) in Nellore cattle. For this, 6910 young bulls with phenotypic information and 23,859 animals genotyped with 435 k markers were used to perform the weighted single-step GBLUP (WssGBLUP) approach, considering two iterations. The top 10 genomic regions explained 8.13, 11.81, and 9.58\% of the additive genetic variance, harboring a total of 119, 143, and 95 positional candidate genes for REA, BF, and HCW, respectively. For meat quality traits, the top 10 windows explained a large proportion of the total genetic variance for SF (14.95\%), MARB (17.56\%), and IMF (21.41\%) surrounding 92, 155, and 111 candidate genes, respectively. Relevant candidate genes (CAST, PLAG1, XKR4, PLAGL2, AQP3/AQP7, MYLK2, WWOX, CARTPT, and PLA2G16) are related to physiological aspects affecting growth, carcass, meat quality, feed intake, and reproductive traits by signaling pathways controlling muscle control, key signal metabolic molecules INS / IGF-1 pathway, lipid metabolism, and adipose tissue development. The GWAS results provided insights into the genetic control of the traits studied and the genes found are potential candidates to be used in the improvement of carcass and meat quality traits.},

	abstract = {The introduction of genomic selection in dairy cattle improvement programs in 2008 was expected to increase rates of genetic gain, particularly for traits with low heritabilities, such as fertility and longevity. Our analysis of the US national dairy database found that generation intervals have decreased dramatically over the past 6 y, and selection intensity for lowly heritable traits has increased considerably. Genetic trends rapidly increased for fertility, lifespan, and udder health. These results clearly demonstrate the positive impact of genomic selection in US dairy cattle, even though this technology has only been in use for a short time. This progress in US Holsteins will have a favorable impact on other populations worldwide due to the widespread dissemination of US germplasm., Seven years after the introduction of genomic selection in the United States, it is now possible to evaluate the impact of this technology on the population. Selection differential(s) (SD) and generation interval(s) (GI) were characterized in a four-path selection model that included sire(s) of bulls (SB), sire(s) of cows (SC), dam(s) of bulls (DB), and dam(s) of cows (DC). Changes in SD over time were estimated for milk, fat, and protein yield; somatic cell score (SCS); productive life (PL); and daughter pregnancy rate (DPR) for the Holstein breed. In the period following implementation of genomic selection, dramatic reductions were seen in GI, especially the SB and SC paths. The SB GI reduced from ∼7 y to less than 2.5 y, and the DB GI fell from about 4 y to nearly 2.5 y. SD were relatively stable for yield traits, although modest gains were noted in recent years. The most dramatic response to genomic selection was observed for the lowly heritable traits DPR, PL, and SCS. Genetic trends changed from close to zero to large and favorable, resulting in rapid genetic improvement in fertility, lifespan, and health in a breed where these traits eroded over time. These results clearly demonstrate the positive impact of genomic selection in US dairy cattle, even though this technology has only been in use for a short time. Based on the four-path selection model, rates of genetic gain per year increased from ∼50–100\% for yield traits and from threefold to fourfold for lowly heritable traits.},

In this study, a two-component genome-based restricted maximum likelihood (GREML) was applied to obtain the additive genetic variance and dominance variance for carcass weight (CW), dressing percentage (DP), meat percentage (MP), average daily gain (ADG), and chuck roll (CR) in 1233 Simmental beef cattle. We estimated predictive abilities using additive models (genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) and BayesA) and dominance models (GBLUP-D and BayesAD). Moreover, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) considering both additive and dominance effects were performed using a multi-locus mixed-model (MLMM) approach. We found that the estimated dominance variances accounted for 15.8\%, 16.1\%, 5.1\%, 4.2\%, and 9.7\% of the total phenotypic variance for CW, DP, MP, ADG, and CR, respectively. Compared with BayesA and GBLUP, we observed 0.5–1.1\% increases in predictive abilities of BayesAD and 0.5–0.9\% increases in predictive abilities of GBLUP-D, respectively. Notably, we identified a dominance association signal for carcass weight within RIMS2, a candidate gene that has been associated with carcass weight in beef cattle. Our results suggest that dominance effects yield variable degrees of contribution to the total genetic variance of the studied traits in Simmental beef cattle. BayesAD and GBLUP-D are convenient models for the improvement of genomic prediction, and the detection of QTLs using a dominance model shows promise for use in GWAS in cattle.},

	abstract = {Genomic selection was adopted very quickly in the 10 yr after first implementation, and breeders continue to find new uses for genomic testing. Breeding values with higher reliability earlier in life are estimated by combining DNA genotypes for many thousands of loci using existing identification, pedigree, and phenotype databases for millions of animals. Quality control for both new and previous data is greatly improved by comparing genomic and pedigree relationships to correct parent–progeny conflicts and discover many additional ancestors. Many quantitative trait loci and gene tests have been added to previous assays that used only evenly spaced, highly polymorphic markers. Imputation now combines genotypes from many assays of differing marker densities. Prediction models have gradually advanced from normal or Bayesian distributions within trait and breed to single-step, multitrait, or other more complex models, such as multibreed models that may be needed for crossbred prediction. Genomic selection was initially applied to males to predict progeny performance but is now widely applied to females or even embryos to predict their own later performance. The initial focus on additive merit has expanded to include mating programs, genomic inbreeding, and recessive alleles. Many producers now use DNA testing to decide which heifers should be inseminated with elite dairy, beef, or sex-sorted semen, which should be embryo donors or recipients, or which should be sold or kept for breeding. Because some of these decisions are expensive to delay, predictions are now provided weekly instead of every few months. Predictions from international genomic databases are often more accurate and cost-effective than those from within-country databases that were previously designed for progeny testing unless local breeds, conditions, or traits differ greatly from the larger database. Selection indexes include many new traits, often with lower heritability or requiring large initial investments to obtain phenotypes, which provide further incentive to cooperate internationally. The genomic prediction methods developed for dairy cattle are now applied widely to many animal, human, and plant populations and could be applied to many more.},

	abstract = {Meat quality traits are economically important because they affect consumers' acceptance, which, in turn, influences the demand for beef. However, selection to improve meat quality is limited by the small numbers of animals on which meat tenderness can be evaluated due to the cost of performing shear force analysis and the resultant damage to the carcass. Genome wide-association studies for Warner-Bratzler shear force measured at different times of meat aging, backfat thickness, ribeye muscle area, scanning parameters [lightness, redness (a*), and yellowness] to ascertain color characteristics of meat and fat, water-holding capacity, cooking loss (CL), and muscle pH were conducted using genotype data from the Illumina BovineHD BeadChip array to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) in all phenotyped Nelore cattle. Phenotype count for these animals ranged from 430 to 536 across traits. Meat quality traits in Nelore are controlled by numerous QTL of small effect, except for a small number of large-effect QTL identified for a*fat, CL, and pH. Genomic regions harboring these QTL and the pathways in which the genes from these regions act appear to differ from those identified in taurine cattle for meat quality traits. These results will guide future QTL mapping studies and the development of models for the prediction of genetic merit to implement genomic selection for meat quality in Nelore cattle.},

	abstract = {Selection index theory was used to compare different selection strategies aiming at the improvement of meat quality in beef cattle. Alternative strategies were compared with a reference scenario with three basic traits in the selection index: BW at 200 d (W200) and 400 d (W400) and muscling score (MUSC). These traits resemble the combination currently used in the German national beef genetic evaluation system. Traits in the breeding goal were defined as the 3 basic traits plus marbling score (MARB), to depict a situation where an established breeding program currently selecting for growth and carcass yield intends to incorporate meat quality in its selection program. Economic weights were either the same for all 4 traits, or doubled or tripled for MARB. Two additional selection criteria for improving MARB were considered: Live animal intramuscular fat content measured by ultrasound (UIMF) as an indicator trait and a genomic breeding value (GEBV) for the target trait directly (gMARB). Results were used to estimate the required number of genotyped animals in an own calibration set for implementing genomic selection focusing on meat quality. Adding UIMF to the basic index increased the overall genetic gain per generation by 15\% when the economic weight on MARB was doubled and by 44\% when it was tripled. When a genomic breeding value for marbling could be estimated with an accuracy of 0.5, adding gMARB to the index provided larger genetic gain than adding UIMF. Greatest genetic gain per generation was obtained with the scenario containing GEBV for 4 traits (gW200, gW400, gMUSC, and gMARB) when the accuracies of these GEBV were ≥0.7. Adding UIMF to the index substantially improved response to selection for MARB, which switched from negative to positive when the economic weight on MARB was doubled or tripled. For all scenarios that contained gMARB in the selection index, the response to selection in MARB was positive for all relative economic weights on MARB, when the accuracy of GEBV was \&gt;0.7. Results indicated that setting up a calibration set of ∼500 genotyped animals with carcass phenotypes for MARB could suffice to obtain a larger response to selection than measuring UIMF.

	abstract = {In March 2014, a continuous genomic evaluation system was introduced in German Holsteins, in addition to routine monthly genomic evaluation. Genomic selection on embryos can lead to a shortened generation interval and substantial savings for breeders. The objectives of this study were to compare genomic breeding values (GEBV) of the continuous with the routine genomic evaluation systems and to investigate the effect of genotype imputation on genomic predictions of embryos. A total of 2440 animals genotyped with Illumina 50K, LD and EuroG10K chips were available between March and April 2014 for comparing genomic evaluations between the two systems. Average differences for all 44 evaluated traits ranged from -4\% to 1\% genetic standard deviations for direct genomic values (DGV) and from -10\% to 5\% genetic standard deviations for GEBV. Depending on the traits, correlations of DGV between the two systems were above 0.995, 0.992, and 0.988 for animals genotyped with 50K, EuroG10K and LD chips, respectively. GEBV correlations exceeded 0.98 for all the traits across all the chip types. Due to the genotype imputing step, DGV variances of embryos increased, on average, by 2\% to 7\% of total additive genetic variance and about half of the variance increase was attributed to Mendelian sampling. For embryos with lower call rates in original genotypes, the increase in DGV variances reached 12\% of total genetic variance. The validation study showed that the continuous genomic evaluation system gave highly consistent results as the routine genomic evaluation. Further developments are needed to minimise differences in statistical methods between the two genomic evaluation systems.},

	abstract = {Traditional marker-assisted selection (MAS) did not result in a widespread use of DNA information in animal breeding. The main reason was that the traits of interest in livestock production were much more complex than expected: they were determined by thousands of genes with small effects on phenotype. These effects were usually too small to be statistically significant and so were ignored.Genomic selection (GS) assumes that all markers might be linked to a gene affecting the trait and concentrates on estimating their effect rather than testing its significance. Three technological breakthroughs resulted in the current wide-spread use of DNA information in animal breeding: the development of the genomic selection technology, the discovery of massive numbers of genetic markers (single nucleotide polymorphisms; SNPs), and high-throughput technology to genotype animals for (hundreds of) thousands of SNPs in a cost-effective manner.Here we review current methods for GS, including how they deal with practical data, where genotypes are missing on a large scale. The use of whole-genome sequence data is anticipated, and its advantages and disadvantages are depicted. Current and predicted future impacts of GS on dairy and beef cattle, pigs, and poultry breeding are described. Finally, future directions for GS are discussed.It is anticipated that future GS applications will either be: within breed (wbGS), where accuracy is obtained by maintaining huge within-breed reference populations; or across breed (abGS) where accuracy is obtained from across-breed reference populations and high-density GS methods that focus on causative genomic regions. We argue that future GS applications will increasingly turn toward abGS.},

	abstract = {Understanding the biological mechanisms underlying tick resistance in cattle holds the potential to facilitate genetic improvement through selective breeding. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) are popular in research on unraveling genetic determinants underlying complex traits such as tick resistance. To date, various studies have been published on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with tick resistance in cattle. The discovery of SNPs related to tick resistance has led to the mapping of associated candidate genes. Despite the success of these studies, information on genetic determinants associated with tick resistance in cattle is still limited. This warrants the need for more studies to be conducted. In Africa, the cost of genotyping is still relatively expensive; thus, conducting GWAS is a challenge, as the minimum number of animals recommended cannot be genotyped. These population size and genotype cost challenges may be overcome through the establishment of collaborations. Thus, the current review discusses GWAS as a tool to uncover SNPs associated with tick resistance, by focusing on the study design, association analysis, factors influencing the success of GWAS, and the progress on cattle tick resistance studies.},

	abstract = {Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus is the main cattle ectoparasite in tropical areas. Gir × Holstein crossbred cows are well adapted to different production systems in Brazil. In this context, we performed genome-wide association study (GWAS) and post-GWAS analyses for R. microplus resistance in an experimental Gir × Holstein F2 population. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) identified in GWAS were used to build gene networks and to investigate the breed of origin for its alleles. Tick artificial infestations were performed during the dry and rainy seasons. Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA) and single-step BLUP procedure was used for GWAS. Post-GWAS analyses were performed by gene ontology terms enrichment and gene transcription factors networks, generated from enriched transcription factors, identified from the promoter sequences of selected gene sets. The genetic origin of marker alleles in the F2 population was assigned using the breed of origin of alleles approach. Heritability estimates for tick counts were 0.40 ± 0.11 in the rainy season and 0.54 ± 0.11 in the dry season. The top ten 0.5-Mbp windows with the highest percentage of genetic variance explained by SNP markers were found in chromosomes 10 and 23 for both the dry and rainy seasons. Gene network analyses allowed the identification of genes involved with biological processes relevant to immune system functions (TREM1, TREM2, and CD83). Gene-transcription factors network allowed the identification of genes involved with immune functions (MYO5A, TREML1, and PRSS16). In resistant animals, the average proportion of animals showing significant SNPs with paternal and maternal alleles originated from Gir breed was 44.8\% whereas the proportion of animals with both paternal and maternal alleles originated from Holstein breed was 11.3\%. Susceptible animals showing both paternal and maternal alleles originated from Holstein breed represented 44.6\% on average, whereas both paternal and maternal alleles originated from Gir breed animals represented 9.3\%. This study allowed us to identify candidate genes for tick resistance in Gir × Holstein crossbreds in both rainy and dry seasons. According to the origin of alleles analysis, we found that most animals classified as resistant showed 2 alleles from Gir breed, while the susceptible ones showed alleles from Holstein. Based on these results, the identified genes may be thoroughly investigated in additional experiments aiming to validate their effects on tick resistance phenotype in cattle.},

	abstract = {Rhipicephalus microplus causes huge losses in cattle. Host genetic background greatly affects the immune efficiency in resistance or susceptibility to tick infestation, which is one of the many factors that play a role on that trait. We performed a systematic review of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for tick resistance in cattle resulting in 1353 candidate genes for post-GWAS analyses. From those, genes showing possible structural variants from the bovine genome were classified by the Variant Effect Predictor from Ensembl. Ninety-two candidate genes showed potential structural variants in 5′ UTR and coding region and were used for functional annotation. Enriched biological processes (e.g. regulation of eosinophil chemotaxis, RIG-I signalling pathway and monocyte differentiation) and candidate genes (e.g. DAPK2, PUM1, ACIN1, INPP5D) linked with immune system function were identified and thus associated with tick resistance. Besides, gene-transcription factors (TFs) networks were obtained from TFs associated with immune system (FOXO3, PPARG, STAT3, NFKB1, GATA3 and ARNT) and the candidate genes associated with tick resistance in cattle highlighted (e.g. OR4L1, PNP, LRRIQ1, GIMAP8, MYO6, MEP1A and LRFN2). Thus, promising candidate genes with a possible functional role for tick resistance in cattle are presented for further in vitro and/or in vivo analyses.},

	abstract = {One of the main animal health problems in tropical and subtropical cattle production is the bovine tick, which causes decreased performance, hide devaluation, increased production costs with acaricide treatments, and transmission of infectious diseases. This study investigated the utility of genomic prediction as a tool to select Braford (BO) and Hereford (HH) cattle resistant to ticks. The accuracy and bias of different methods for direct and blended genomic prediction was assessed using 10,673 tick counts obtained from 3,435 BO and 928 HH cattle belonging to the Delta G Connection breeding program. A subset of 2,803 BO and 652 HH samples were genotyped and 41,045 markers remained after quality control. Log transformed records were adjusted by a pedigree repeatability model to estimate variance components, genetic parameters, and breeding values (EBV) and subsequently used to obtain deregressed EBV. Estimated heritability and repeatability for tick counts were 0.19 ± 0.03 and 0.29 ± 0.01, respectively. Data were split into 5 subsets using k-means and random clustering for cross-validation of genomic predictions. Depending on the method, direct genomic value (DGV) prediction accuracies ranged from 0.35 with Bayes least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to 0.39 with BayesB for k-means clustering and between 0.42 with BayesLASSO and 0.45 with BayesC for random clustering. All genomic methods were superior to pedigree BLUP (PBLUP) accuracies of 0.26 for k-means and 0.29 for random groups, with highest accuracy gains obtained with BayesB (39\%) for k-means and BayesC (55\%) for random groups. Blending of historical phenotypic and pedigree information by different methods further increased DGV accuracies by values between 0.03 and 0.05 for direct prediction methods. However, highest accuracy was observed with single-step genomic BLUP with values of 0.48 for k-means and 0.56, which represent, respectively, 84 and 93\% improvement over PBLUP. Observed random clustering cross-validation breed-specific accuracies ranged between 0.29 and 0.36 for HH and between 0.55 and 0.61 for BO, depending on the blending method. These moderately high values for BO demonstrate that genomic predictions could be used as a practical tool to improve genetic resistance to ticks and in the development of resistant lines of this breed. For HH, accuracies are still in the low to moderate side and this breed training population needs to be increased before genomic selection could be reliably applied to improve tick resistance.},

Cattle resistance to ticks is one of the most important factors affecting tick control, but largely neglected due to the challenge of phenotyping. In this study, we evaluate the pooling of tick resistance phenotyped reference populations from multi-country beef cattle breeds to assess the possibility of improving host resistance through multi-trait genomic selection. Data consisted of tick counts or scores assessing the number of female ticks at least 4.5 mm length and derived from seven populations, with breed, country, number of records and genotyped/phenotyped animals being respectively: Angus (AN), Brazil, 2,263, 921/1,156, Hereford (HH), Brazil, 6,615, 1,910/2,802, Brangus (BN), Brazil, 2,441, 851/851, Braford (BO), Brazil, 9,523, 3,062/4,095, Tropical Composite (TC), Australia, 229, 229/229, Brahman (BR), Australia, 675, 675/675, and Nguni (NG), South Africa, 490, 490/490. All populations were genotyped using medium density Illumina SNP BeadChips and imputed to a common high-density panel of 332,468 markers. The mean linkage disequilibrium (LD) between adjacent SNPs varied from 0.24 to 0.37 across populations and so was sufficient to allow genomic breeding values (GEBV) prediction. Correlations of LD phase between breeds were higher between composites and their founder breeds (0.81 to 0.95) and lower between NG and the other breeds (0.27 and 0.35). There was wide range of estimated heritability (0.05 and 0.42) and genetic correlation (-0.01 and 0.87) for tick resistance across the studied populations, with the largest genetic correlation observed between BN and BO. Predictive ability was improved under the old-young validation for three of the seven populations using a multi-trait approach compared to a single trait within-population prediction, while whole and partial data GEBV correlations increased in all cases, with relative improvements ranging from 3\% for BO to 64\% for TC. Moreover, the multi-trait analysis was useful to correct typical over-dispersion of the GEBV. Results from this study indicate that a joint genomic evaluation of AN, HH, BN, BO and BR can be readily implemented to improve tick resistance of these populations using selection on GEBV. For NG and TC additional phenotyping will be required to obtain accurate GEBV.},

	abstract = {Currently, genomic evaluations use multiple-step procedures, which are prone to biases and errors. A single-step procedure may be applicable when genomic predictions can be obtained by modifying the numerator relationship matrix A to H = A + AΔ, where AΔ includes deviations from expected relationships. However, the traditional mixed model equations require H−1, which is usually difficult to obtain for large pedigrees. The computations with H are feasible when the mixed model equations are expressed in an alternate form that also applies for singular H and when those equations are solved by the conjugate gradient techniques. Then the only computations involving H are in the form of Aq or AΔq, where q is a vector. The alternative equations have a nonsymmetric left-hand side. Computing AΔq is inexpensive when the number of nonzeros in AΔ is small, and the product Aq can be calculated efficiently in linear time using an indirect algorithm. Generalizations to more complicated models are proposed. The data included 10.2million final scores on 6.2million Holsteins and were analyzed by a repeatability model. Comparisons involved the regular and the alternative equations. The model for the second case included simulated AΔ. Solutions were obtained by the preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm, which works only with symmetric matrices, and by the bi-conjugate gradient stabilized algorithm, which also works with nonsymmetric matrices. The convergence rate associated with the nonsymmetric solvers was slightly better than that with the symmetric solver for the original equations, although the time per round was twice as much for the nonsymmetric solvers. The convergence rate associated with the alternative equations ranged from 2 times lower without AΔ to 3 times lower for the largest simulated AΔ. When the information attributable to genomics can be expressed as modifications to the numerator relationship matrix, the proposed methodology may allow the upgrading of an existing evaluation to incorporate the genomic information.},

	abstract = {Canada's climate is warming faster than the global average, but the warming is unevenly distributed. This study analyzes historical and future climate change in dairy-producing regions across Canada to better understand how Canada's dairy cows are affected. Historical changes (i.e., 1960–2019) were assessed using temperature and humidity data from 29 weather stations across the country. The temperature–humidity index (THI) was used as an indicator of dairy cattle at risk of heat stress, and three THI metrics evaluated the frequency, severity, and duration of potential heat stress. Future scenarios were investigated using five global climate models to project daily THI under three Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). Projections were grouped into three time periods (2020–2049, 2040–2069, and 2060–2089). Historical climate trends show an increase in temperature, humidity, and THI exceedance in most west coast and eastern Canada locations, affecting 84\% of the national dairy herd. Future scenarios project that 90\% of the national herd will experience a large increase in the frequency, severity, and duration of THI exceedance under all but the most optimistic SSP. These findings highlight the need for Canadian dairy farmers to consider heat-stress adaptation strategies.},

	title = {Implementation of {Methane} {Efficiency} {Evaluations} for {Canadian} {Holsteins}},
	abstract = {Methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas (GHG) that warms the atmosphere at a rate 25 to 27 times more than that of carbon dioxide. The average first parity Holstein cow produces nearly 500 g of CH4 per day or 180 kg per year, mainly due to enteric fermentation. A 30\% difference above or below average can also be seen between cows, meaning two cows in the same herd can differ in their CH4 emissions by up to 110 kg per year. As such, using genetics to select for cows with reduced CH4 emissions is a strategy that can combat global warming and improve the efficiency of the dairy industry. In April 2023, Lactanet launched genomic evaluations for Methane Efficiency using milk mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy data. Previous research using artificial neural network methods determined that a cow’s milk MIR spectral data can be used as a good predictor of its CH4 emissions. Lactanet developed CH4 predictions using CH4 data collected from research herds in Canada through two research projects, the Efficient Dairy Genome Project and the Resilient Dairy Genome Project, and milk spectral data collected via Canadian milk recording services. Predicted CH4 (g/d) has a genetic correlation with collected CH4 of 0.92 and a heritability of 0.23 (0.01). Lactanet’s genomic evaluation for Methane Efficiency was developed for the Holstein breed using a 4-trait Single-Step linear animal model including predicted CH4 and milk, fat and protein yields as correlated traits. Methane Efficiency is defined as genetic Residual Methane Production in 120-185 DIM of first lactation and is genetically independent of production yields via a linear regression approach. The first genomic evaluation for Methane Efficiency included first lactation records on over 500 000 cows in Canadian milk recorded herds, of which more than 60 000 were genotyped. The average reliability of Methane Efficiency for genotyped young bulls and heifers exceeds 70\%. Methane Efficiency is expressed as a Relative Breeding Value (RBV) averaging 100 and ranging from 85 to 115. For every 5-point increase in a sire’s RBV for Methane Efficiency, daughters are expected to produce approximately 3 kilograms less CH4 per year. This equates to a 1.5\% reduction in CH4 emissions per cow per year and a herd can achieve a 20\% to 30\% reduction by 2050 through genetic selection. Methane Efficiency does not have a significant undesirable correlation with any other trait, including LPI, Pro\$, production yields and Feed Efficiency.},

	abstract = {Population stratification has long been recognized as a confounding factor in genetic association studies. Estimated ancestries, derived from multi-locus genotype data, can be used to perform a statistical correction for population stratification. One popular technique for estimation of ancestry is the model-based approach embodied by the widely applied program structure. Another approach, implemented in the program EIGENSTRAT, relies on Principal Component Analysis rather than model-based estimation and does not directly deliver admixture fractions. EIGENSTRAT has gained in popularity in part owing to its remarkable speed in comparison to structure. We present a new algorithm and a program, ADMIXTURE, for model-based estimation of ancestry in unrelated individuals. ADMIXTURE adopts the likelihood model embedded in structure. However, ADMIXTURE runs considerably faster, solving problems in minutes that take structure hours. In many of our experiments, we have found that ADMIXTURE is almost as fast as EIGENSTRAT. The runtime improvements of ADMIXTURE rely on a fast block relaxation scheme using sequential quadratic programming for block updates, coupled with a novel quasi-Newton acceleration of convergence. Our algorithm also runs faster and with greater accuracy than the implementation of an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm incorporated in the program FRAPPE. Our simulations show that ADMIXTURE's maximum likelihood estimates of the underlying admixture coefficients and ancestral allele frequencies are as accurate as structure's Bayesian estimates. On real-world data sets, ADMIXTURE's estimates are directly comparable to those from structure and EIGENSTRAT. Taken together, our results show that ADMIXTURE's computational speed opens up the possibility of using a much larger set of markers in model-based ancestry estimation and that its estimates are suitable for use in correcting for population stratification in association studies.},

Here we report a user-friendly software tool called genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA), which was developed based on a method we recently developed to address the "missing heritability" problem. GCTA estimates the variance explained by all the SNPs on a chromosome or on the whole genome for a complex trait rather than testing the association of any particular SNP to the trait. We introduce GCTA's five main functions: data management, estimation of the genetic relationships from SNPs, mixed linear model analysis of variance explained by the SNPs, estimation of the linkage disequilibrium structure, and GWAS simulation. We focus on the function of estimating the variance explained by all the SNPs on the X chromosome and testing the hypotheses of dosage compensation. The GCTA software is a versatile tool to estimate and partition complex trait variation with large GWAS data sets.},

The phenotypic database was composed by Charolais, Caracu, Aberdeen Angus, and Canchim purebred and crossbred animals. Single-trait analyses were performed using models that included the maternal effect for WW and YW traits, and a model ignoring this effect on YW (YWNM). The Deviance Information Criterion (DIC), model posterior probabilities (MPP), accuracy of breeding values (ACC), and Spearman’s rank correlation were applied to compare the models including and ignoring the maternal effect on YW. Sex and age of dam at calving had significant effects on WW and YW. The direct heritability estimates were 0.21±0.03 and 0.05±0.02, and the maternal heritabilities were 0.11±0.02 and 0.02±0.01 for WW and YW, respectively. The heritabilities estimated for YW may have been influenced by the several genetic groups in the population and by used conventional animal model, which may not have been the better fit model to evaluate YW in this population. The DIC, MPP, and ACC values indicated that YW outperformed the YWNM model, but the rank correlation and percentages of individuals selected in common suggested that the best animals would be selected independently of the model chosen.},

	abstract = {Purunã is a composite beef cattle breed, developed in Southern Brazil by crossing the Angus, Charolais, Canchim, and Caracu breeds. The goal of this study was to perform the ﬁrst genetic characterization of the Purunã breed, based on both pedigree and genomic information. For this, 100 randomly selected animals were genotyped, and 11,205 animals born from 1997 to 2019 had pedigree information. The genetic analyses performed were principal component analysis, admixture, phylogenic tree, pedigree and genomic inbreeding, linkage disequilibrium (LD), effective population size (Ne), consistency of the gametic phase, runs of homozygosity (ROH), heterozygosity-enriched regions (HERs), and functional analyses of the ROH and HER regions identiﬁed. Our ﬁndings indicate that Purunã is more genetically related to the Charolais, Canchim, and Angus breeds than Caracu or Nellore. The levels of inbreeding were shown to be small based on all the metrics evaluated and ranged from −0.009 to 0.029. A low (−0.12–0.31) correlation of the pedigree-based inbreeding compared to all the genomic inbreeding coefﬁcients evaluated was observed. The LD average was 0.031 (±0.0517), and the consistency of the gametic phase was shown to be low for all the breed pairs, ranging from 0.42 to 0.27 to the distance of 20 Mb. The Ne values based on pedigree and genomic information were 158 and 115, respectively. A total of 1,839 ROHs were found, and the majority of them are of small length ({\textless}4 Mb). An important homozygous region was identiﬁed on BTA5 with pathways related to behavioral traits (sensory perception, detection of stimulus, and others), as well as candidate genes related to heat tolerance (MY O 1A), feed conversion rate (RDH5), and reproduction (AMDHD1). A total of 1,799 HERs were identiﬁed in the Purunã breed with 92.3\% of them classiﬁed within the 0.5–1 Mb length group, and 19 HER islands were identiﬁed in the autosomal genome. These HER islands harbor genes involved in growth pathways, carcass weight (SDCBP), meat and carcass quality (MT2A), and marbling deposition (CISH). Despite the genetic relationship between Purunã and the founder breeds, a multi-breed genomic evaluation is likely not feasible due to their population structure and low consistency of the gametic phase among them.},

	abstract = {This study aimed to build gene-biological process networks with differentially expressed genes associated with economically important traits of Nelore cattle from 17 previous studies. The genes were clustered into three groups by evaluated traits: group 1, production traits; group 2, carcass traits; and group 3, meat quality traits. For each group, a gene-biological process network analysis was performed with the differentially expressed genes in common. For production traits, 37 genes were found in common, of which 13 genes were enriched for six Gene Ontology (GO) terms; these terms were not functionally grouped. However, the enriched GO terms were related to homeostasis, the development of muscles and the immune system. For carcass traits, four genes were found in common. Thus, it was not possible to functionally group these genes into a network. For meat quality traits, the analysis revealed 222 genes in common. CSRP3 was the only gene differentially expressed in all three groups. Non-redundant biological terms for clusters of genes were functionally grouped networks, reflecting the cross-talk between all biological processes and genes involved. Many biological processes and pathways related to muscles, the immune system and lipid metabolism were enriched, such as striated muscle cell development and triglyceride metabolic processes. This study provides insights into the genetic mechanisms of production, carcass and meat quality traits of Nelore cattle.

	abstract = {It is now widely accepted that dairy cow performance is influenced by both the host genome and rumen microbiome composition. The contributions of the genome and the microbiome to the phenotypes of interest are quantified by heritability (h2) and microbiability (m2), respectively. However, if the genome and microbiome are included in the model, then the heritability reflects only the contribution of the direct genetic effects quantified as direct heritability (hd2), and the holobiont effect reflects the joint action of the genome and the microbiome, quantified as the holobiability (ho2). The objectives of this study were to estimate h2, hd2, m2, and ho2 for dry matter intake, milk energy, and residual feed intake; and to evaluate the predictive ability of different models, including genome, microbiome, and their interaction. Data consisted of feed efficiency records, SNP genotype data, and 16S rRNA rumen microbial abundances from 448 mid-lactation Holstein cows from 2 research farms. Three kernel models were fit to each trait: one with only the genomic effect (model G), one with the genomic and microbiome effects (model GM), and one with the genomic, microbiome, and interaction effects (model GMO). The model GMO, or holobiont model, showed the best goodness-of-fit. The hd2 estimates were always 10 to 15\% lower than h2 estimates for all traits, suggesting a mediated genetic effect through the rumen microbiome, and m2 estimates were moderate for all traits, and up to 26\% for milk energy. The ho2 was greater than the sum of hd2 and m2, suggesting that the genome-by-microbiome interaction had a sizeable effect on feed efficiency. Kernel models fitting the rumen microbiome, i.e., models GM and GMO, showed larger predictive correlations and smaller prediction bias than the model G. These findings reveal a moderate contribution of the rumen microbiome to feed efficiency traits in lactating Holstein cows and strongly suggest that the rumen microbiome mediates part of the host genetic effect.},

Therefore, the incorporation of data on genotyped and non-genotyped animals in this method is straightforward. Since 2009, two main implementations of single-step were proposed. One is called single-step genomic best linear unbiased prediction (ssGBLUP) and uses single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) to construct the genomic relationship matrix; the other is the single-step Bayesian regression (ssBR), which is a marker effect model. Under the same assumptions, both models are equivalent. In this review, we focus solely on ssGBLUP. The implementation of ssGBLUP into the BLUPF90 software suite was done in 2009, and since then, several changes were made to make ssGBLUP flexible to any model, number of traits, number of phenotypes, and number of genotyped animals. Single-step GBLUP from the BLUPF90 software suite has been used for genomic evaluations worldwide. In this review, we will show theoretical developments and numerical examples of ssGBLUP using SNP data from regular chips to sequence data.},

Our findings indicate that, according to ANOVA and meta-analysis, the composition of goat milk includes 12.65\% and 12.81\% total solids (TS), 4.06\% and 4.13\% fat, 3.53\% and 3.52\% protein, and 4.42\% and 4.44\% lactose, respectively. The grade of evidence for total solids, protein, and lactose was high, while fat received a moderate grading. Pearson correlation analysis and PCA demonstrated a positive correlation among fat, total solids, protein, and ash. No significant correlation was found between lactose and ash content with the other components. PCA analysis disclosed that compositional variations in goat milk during early and late lactation stages were mainly related to changes in TS, fat, and protein. This review provides valuable insights for the goat milk dairy industry, aiding in the understanding of variations in the composition of goat milk.},

However, little is known about the regions of the genome that influence these traits in goats. We conducted a genome wide association study in French goats and identified 109 regions associated with dairy traits. For a major region on chromosome 14 closely associated with fat content, the Diacylglycerol O-Acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) gene turned out to be a functional and positional candidate gene. The caprine reference sequence of this gene was completed and 29 polymorphisms were found in the gene sequence, including two novel exonic mutations: R251L and R396W, leading to substitutions in the protein sequence. The R251L mutation was found in the Saanen breed at a frequency of 3.5\% and the R396W mutation both in the Saanen and Alpine breeds at a frequencies of 13\% and 7\% respectively. The R396W mutation explained 46\% of the genetic variance of the trait, and the R251L mutation 6\%. Both mutations were associated with a notable decrease in milk fat content. Their causality was then demonstrated by a functional test. These results provide new knowledge on the genetic basis of milk synthesis and will help improve the management of the French dairy goat breeding program.},

In Peru, the province of Sullana stands out as the largest producer of this cheese. However, there is limited knowledge regarding the socioeconomic factors of its producers, as well as the physicochemical and microbiological characteristics of the cheese. The study was developed in 3 aspects, socio-economic based on a descriptive exploratory methodology, with a mixed approach, 14 presidents of producer associations participated. Fourteen samples of fresh artisanal cheese from goat producers' associations from Marcavelica, Lancones and Salitral were stored at 4°C under aseptic conditions for physico-chemical characterisation and microbiological analysis. In relation to socioeconomic factors, the findings of the survey indicate that 42.9\% were aged 56 years or older and possess only primary education. Additionally, 57.1\% received Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) training, 86\% reported a lack of water and drainage services, 21\% reported having access to conventional electricity and 79\% reported using solar panels. These make an improvement in the training of cheese producers imperative. Regarding the physicochemical properties (pH, acidity, humidity and ash content), the cheeses were within the parameters allowed in DS N° 007-2021-MINAGRI. However, it was observed that 29\% and 50\% of the samples exhibited a high count for aerophilic mesophiles at 24 (≥ 2.51 x 106 CFU/g) and 48 (≥ 2.34 x 106 CFU/g) hours, respectively (COVENIN 3338:1997). 79\% of the samples tested positive for both total and fecal coliforms (DS N° 007-2021-MINAGRI) in which 43\% exhibited a high count for E. coli ({\textgreater}3.6 MPN/g). Conversely, the presence of S. aureus ({\textless}10) was within the optimal parameters while Salmonella spp. and L. monocytogenes were not detected. The lack of adequate infrastructure for the milking process, the production, storage and transportation of cheese, is presented as the most significant aspect. These findings may pose a risk to consumers’ health, highlighting the necessity to establish projects that strengthen these aspects in order to enhance cheese production.},

	abstract = {Background
Distinct domestication events, adaptation to different climatic zones, and divergent selection in productive traits have shaped the genomic differences between taurine and indicine cattle. In this study, we assessed the impact of artificial selection and environmental adaptation by comparing whole-genome sequences from European taurine and Asian indicine breeds and from African cattle. Next, we studied the impact of divergent selection by exploiting predicted and experimental functional annotation of the bovine genome.

Results
We identified selective sweeps in beef cattle taurine and indicine populations, including a 430-kb selective sweep on indicine cattle chromosome 5 that is located between 47,670,001 and 48,100,000 bp and spans five genes, i.e. HELB, IRAK3, ENSBTAG00000026993, GRIP1 and part of HMGA2. Regions under selection in indicine cattle display significant enrichment for promoters and coding genes. At the nucleotide level, sites that show a strong divergence in allele frequency between European taurine and Asian indicine are enriched for the same functional categories. We identified nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in coding regions that are fixed for different alleles between subspecies, eight of which were located within the DNA helicase B (HELB) gene. By mining information from the 1000 Bull Genomes Project, we found that HELB carries mutations that are specific to indicine cattle but also found in taurine cattle, which are known to have been subject to indicine introgression from breeds, such as N’Dama, Anatolian Red, Marchigiana, Chianina, and Piedmontese. Based on in-house genome sequences, we proved that mutations in HELB segregate independently of the copy number variation HMGA2-CNV, which is located in the same region.

Conclusions
Major genomic sequence differences between Bos taurus and Bos indicus are enriched for promoter and coding regions. We identified a 430-kb selective sweep in Asian indicine cattle located on chromosome 5, which carries SNPs that are fixed in indicine populations and located in the coding sequences of the HELB gene. HELB is involved in the response to DNA damage including exposure to ultra-violet light and is associated with reproductive traits and yearling weight in tropical cattle. Thus, HELB likely contributed to the adaptation of tropical cattle to their harsh environment.},

	abstract = {This study is first to perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to investigate the milk quality traits in Karachai goats. The objective of the study was to identify candidate genes associated with milk composition traits based on the identification and subsequent analysis of all possible SNPs, both genome-wide (high-confidence) and suggestive (subthreshold significance). To estimate the milk components, 22 traits were determined, including several types of fatty acids. DNA was extracted from ear tissue or blood samples. A total of 167 Karachai goats were genotyped using an Illumina GoatSNP53K BeadChip panel (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Overall, we identified 167 highly significant and subthreshold SNPs associated with the milk components of Karachai goats. A total of 10 SNPs were located within protein-coding genes and 33 SNPs in close proximity to them (±0.2 Mb). The largest number of genome-wide significant SNPs was found on chromosomes 2 and 8 and some of them were associated with several traits. The greatest number of genome-wide significant SNPs was identified for crude protein and lactose (6), and the smallest number—only 1 SNP—for freezing point depression. No SNPs were identified for monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Functional annotation of all 43 SNPs allowed us to identify 66 significant candidate genes on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 13, 16, 18, 21, 23, 25, 26, and 27. We considered these genes potential DNA markers of the fatty acid composition of Karachai goat milk. Also, we found 12 genes that had a polygenic effect: most of them were simultaneously associated with the dry matter content and fatty acids (METTL, SLC1A 8, PHACTR1, FMO2, ECI1, PGP, ABCA3, AMDHD2). Our results suggest that the genes identified in our study affecting the milk components in Karachai goats differed from those identified in other breeds of dairy goats.},

Measuring stayability at an earlier age could be a reasonable strategy to avoid this problem. In this sense, a better understanding of the genetic architecture of this trait at different ages and/or at different calvings is important. This study was conducted to identify possible regions with major effects on stayability measured considering different numbers of calvings in Nellore cattle as well as pathways that can be involved in its expression throughout the female’s productive life.},

	doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btq559},
	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been widely used to map loci contributing to variation in complex traits and risk of diseases in humans. Accurate specification of familial relationships is crucial for family-based GWAS, as well as in population-based GWAS with unknown (or unrecognized) family structure. The family structure in a GWAS should be routinely investigated using the SNP data prior to the analysis of population structure or phenotype. Existing algorithms for relationship inference have a major weakness of estimating allele frequencies at each SNP from the entire sample, under a strong assumption of homogeneous population structure. This assumption is often untenable.
RESULTS: Here, we present a rapid algorithm for relationship inference using high-throughput genotype data typical of GWAS that allows the presence of unknown population substructure. The relationship of any pair of individuals can be precisely inferred by robust estimation of their kinship coefficient, independent of sample composition or population structure (sample invariance). We present simulation experiments to demonstrate that the algorithm has sufficient power to provide reliable inference on millions of unrelated pairs and thousands of relative pairs (up to 3rd-degree relationships). Application of our robust algorithm to HapMap and GWAS datasets demonstrates that it performs properly even under extreme population stratification, while algorithms assuming a homogeneous population give systematically biased results. Our extremely efficient implementation performs relationship inference on millions of pairs of individuals in a matter of minutes, dozens of times faster than the most efficient existing algorithm known to us.
AVAILABILITY: Our robust relationship inference algorithm is implemented in a freely available software package, KING, available for download at http://people.virginia.edu/∼wc9c/KING.},

	abstract = {The effects of increased pedigree inbreeding in dairy cattle populations have been well documented and result in a negative impact on profitability. Recent advances in genotyping technology have allowed researchers to move beyond pedigree analysis and study inbreeding at a molecular level. In this study, 5,853 animals were genotyped for 54,001 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP); 2,913 cows had phenotypic records including a single lactation for milk yield (from either lactation 1, 2, 3, or 4), reproductive performance, and linear type conformation. After removing SNP with poor call rates, low minor allele frequencies, and departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, 33,025 SNP remained for analyses. Three measures of genomic inbreeding were evaluated: percent homozygosity (FPH), inbreeding calculated from runs of homozygosity (FROH), and inbreeding derived from a genomic relationship matrix (FGRM). Average FPH was 60.5±1.1\%, average FROH was 3.8±2.1\%, and average FGRM was 20.8±2.3\%, where animals with larger values for each of the genomic inbreeding indices were considered more inbred. Decreases in total milk yield to 205d postpartum of 53, 20, and 47kg per 1\% increase in FPH, FROH, and FGRM, respectively, were observed. Increases in days open per 1\% increase in FPH (1.76 d), FROH (1.72 d), and FGRM (1.06 d) were also noted, as well as increases in maternal calving difficulty (0.09, 0.03, and 0.04 on a 5-point scale for FPH, FROH, and FGRM, respectively). Several linear type traits, such as strength (−0.40, −0.11, and −0.19), rear legs rear view (−0.35, −0.16, and −0.14), front teat placement (0.35, 0.25, 0.18), and teat length (−0.24, −0.14, and −0.13) were also affected by increases in FPH, FROH, and FGRM, respectively. Overall, increases in each measure of genomic inbreeding in this study were associated with negative effects on production and reproductive ability in dairy cows.},

	abstract = {Goats are important livestock mainly recognized for their low rearing costs and adaptability to harsh climate making them suitable for small farmers. Goat’s milk has been tagged as highly consumed milk in many parts of the world and also carry essential substances as minerals, vitamins, enzymes, proteins, electrolytes and fatty acids which are easily metabolised by the body. The unique health benefits of goat milk make it a remedy for various disease conditions. Additionally, the low allergenicity and high digestibility of goat milk make it a popular dairy product for infants and immunocompromised individuals. This review summarizes the efforts and achievements made in analyzing goat milk’s nutritional, therapeutic, and functional properties and its current applications in the food and nutraceuticals sector. Also, the article provides insights into the diverse range of food and cosmetics applications of goat milk-derived components. Besides the long history of the use of goat milk for human nutrition, the scientific literature concerning various bioactive components and their beneficial therapeutic effects with respect to modern science are also reviewed in detail.},

The last decade, ROH analyses have become the state-of-the-art method for inbreeding assessment. In PLINK, the --homozyg function is used to perform ROH analyses and relies on several input settings. These settings can have a large impact on the outcome and default values are not always appropriate for medium density SNP array data. Guidelines for a robust and uniform ROH analysis in PLINK using medium density data are lacking, albeit these guidelines are vital for comparing different ROH studies. In this study, 8 populations of different livestock and pet species are used to demonstrate the importance of PLINK input settings. Moreover, the effects of pruning SNPs for low minor allele frequencies and linkage disequilibrium on ROH detection are shown.},

ROH are continuous homozygous segments that are common in individuals and populations. The ability of these homozygous segments to give insight into a population's genetic events makes them a useful tool that can provide information about the demographic evolution of a population over time. Furthermore, ROH provide useful information about the genetic relatedness among individuals, helping to minimize the inbreeding rate and also helping to expose deleterious variants in the genome. The frequency, size and distribution of ROH in the genome are influenced by factors such as natural and artificial selection, recombination, linkage disequilibrium, population structure, mutation rate and inbreeding level. Calculating the inbreeding coefficient from molecular information from ROH (FROH) is more accurate for estimating autozygosity and for detecting both past and more recent inbreeding effects than are estimates from pedigree data (FPED). The better results of FROH suggest that FROH can be used to infer information about the history and inbreeding levels of a population in the absence of genealogical information. The selection of superior animals has produced large phenotypic changes and has reshaped the ROH patterns in various regions of the genome. Additionally, selection increases homozygosity around the target locus, and deleterious variants are seen to occur more frequently in ROH regions. Studies involving ROH are increasingly common and provide valuable information about how the genome's architecture can disclose a population's genetic background. By revealing the molecular changes in populations over time, genome-wide information is crucial to understanding antecedent genome architecture and, therefore, to maintaining diversity and fitness in endangered livestock breeds.},

	abstract = {Runs of homozygosity (ROH) segments, contiguous homozygous regions in a genome were traditionally linked to families and inbred populations. However, a growing literature suggests that ROHs are ubiquitous in outbred populations. Still, most existing genetic studies of ROH in populations are limited to aggregated ROH content across the genome, which does not offer the resolution for mapping causal loci. This limitation is mainly due to a lack of methods for efficient identification of shared ROH diplotypes. Here, we present a new method, ROH-DICE, to find large ROH diplotype clusters, sufficiently long ROHs shared by a sufficient number of individuals, in large cohorts. ROH-DICE identified over 1 million ROH diplotypes that span over 100 SNPs and shared by more than 100 UK Biobank participants. Moreover, we found significant associations of clustered ROH diplotypes across the genome with various self-reported diseases, with the strongest associations found between the extended HLA region and autoimmune disorders. We found an association between a diplotype covering the HFE gene and haemochromatosis, even though the well-known causal SNP was not directly genotyped nor imputed. Using genome-wide scan, we identified a putative association between carriers of an ROH diplotype in chromosome 4 and an increase of mortality among COVID-19 patients. In summary, our ROH-DICE method, by calling out large ROH diplotypes in a large outbred population, enables further population genetics into the demographic history of large populations. More importantly, our method enables a new genome-wide mapping approach for finding disease-causing loci with multi-marker recessive effects at population scale.},

	abstract = {The U.S. dairy industry considerably reduced environmental impacts between 1944 and 2007, primarily through improved dairy cow productivity. However, although milk yield per cow has increased over the past decade, whole-system environmental impact analyses have not been conducted over this time period, during which environmental modeling science has improved considerably. The objective of this study was to compare the environmental impact of U.S. dairy cattle production in 2007–2017. A deterministic model based on population demographics, metabolism, and nutrient requirements of dairy cattle was used to estimate resource inputs, nutrient excretion, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per 1.0 × 106 t (one million metric t or MMT) of energy-corrected milk (ECM) produced in 2007 and 2017. System boundaries extended from the manufacture and transport of cropping inputs to milk at the farm gate. Milk transport, processing, and retail were not included. Dairy systems were modeled using typical management practices, herd population dynamics, and production data from U.S. dairy farms. Cropping data were sourced from national databases. The resources required to produce 1.0 MMT ECM in 2017 were considerably reduced relative to those required in 2007, with 2017 production systems using 74.8\% of the cattle, 82.7\% of the feedstuffs, 79.2\% of the land, and 69.5\% of the water as compared to 2007. Waste outputs were similarly reduced, with the 2017 U.S. dairy industry producing 79.4\%, 82.5\%, and 85.7\% of the manure, N, and P excretion, respectively. Dairy production in 2017 emitted 80.9\% of the CH4 and 81.5\% of the N2O per 1.0 MMT ECM compared to 2007. Enteric and manure emissions contributed the major proportion (80\%) of GHG emissions per unit of milk, with lesser contributions from cropping (7.6\%) and fertilizer application (5.3\%). The GHG emissions per 1.0 MMT ECM produced in 2017 were 80.8\% of equivalent milk production in 2007. Consequently, although total U.S. ECM production increased by 24.9\% between 2007 and 2017, total GHG emissions from this milk production increased by only 1.0\%. In line with previous historical analyses, the U.S. dairy industry has made remarkable productivity gains and environmental progress over time. To maintain this culture of continuous improvement, the dairy industry must build on gains made to date and demonstrate its commitment to reducing environmental impacts while improving both economic viability and social acceptability.},

	abstract = {The large-scale recording of traits such as feed efficiency and methane emissions for use in genetic improvement programs is complex, costly, and time-consuming. Therefore, heritable traits that can be continuously recorded in dairy herds and are correlated to feed efficiency and methane emission traits could provide useful information for genetic evaluation. Rumination time has been suggested to be associated with feed efficiency, methane production (methane emission in g/day), and production traits at the phenotypic level. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the genetic relationships among rumination time, feed efficiency, methane and production traits using 7,358 records from 656 first lactation Holstein cows. The estimated heritabilities were moderate for rumination time (0.45 ± 0.14), methane production (0.36 ± 0.12), milk yield (0.40 ± 0.08), fat yield (0.29 ± 0.06), protein yield (0.32 ± 0.07), and energy corrected milk (0.28 ± 0.07), while low and non-significant for feed efficiency (0.15 ± 0.07), which was defined as the residual of the multiple linear regression of DMI on ECM and MBW. A favorable negative genetic correlation was estimated between rumination time and methane production (−0.53 ± 0.24), while a positive favorable correlation was estimated between rumination time and energy corrected milk (0.49 ± 0.11). The estimated genetic correlation of rumination time with feed efficiency (−0.01 ± 0.17) was not significantly different from zero but showed a trend of a low correlation with dry matter intake (0.21 ± 0.13, P = 0.11). These results indicate that rumination time is genetically associated with methane production and milk production traits, but high standard errors indicate that further analyses should be conducted to verify these findings when more data for rumination time, methane production and feed efficiency become available.},

	abstract = {Milk yield and composition phenotypes are systematically recorded across several lactations in goats, but the majority of genome-­wide association studies (GWAS) performed so far have rather ignored the longitudinal nature of such data. Here, we have used two different GWAS approaches to analyse data from three lactations recorded in Murciano-­Granadina goats. In Analysis 1, independent GWAS have been carried out for each trait and lactation, while a single longitudinal GWAS, jointly considering all data, has been performed in Analysis 2. In both analyses, genome-­wide significant QTL for lactose percentage on chromosome 2 (129.77–131.01 Mb) and for milk protein percentage on the chromosome 6 (74.8–94.6 Mb) casein gene cluster region were detected. In Analysis 1, several QTL were not replicated in all three lactations, possibly due to the existence of lactation-­specific genetic determinants. In Analysis 2, we identified several genome-­wide significant QTL related to milk yield and protein content that were not uncovered in Analysis 1. The increased number of QTL identified in Analysis 2 suggests that the longitudinal GWAS is particularly well suited for the genetic analysis of dairy traits. Moreover, our data confirm that variability within or close to the casein complex is the main genetic determinant of milk protein percentage in Murciano-­Granadina goats.},

Since the membrane surrounding the lipid droplet is derived from the plasma membrane of the cell, it is clear that a part of the cell is lost to become a part of the cellular secretion. This is an example of an apocrine mode of secretion. For secretion of specific milk proteins and milk sugar (lactose), these products are packaged into secretory vesicles in the Golgi apparatus. These vesicles both singly or in chains fuse with the apical plasma membrane and release their contents via exocytosis.

	abstract = {Broadly goats are seasonal breeders and in India, their breeding season is usually from April to November. Although there are some breeds that cycle round the year. The oestrous cycle consists of all morphological and physiological changes in the ovaries and genital tract leading to oestrus expression (phase of receptivity towards buck) and ovulation and the preparation of genital tract for copulation, fertilisation and embryo implantation. Oestrous cycles can be initiated out of season by controlling artificial lights to stimulate decreasing daylights. Goats are spontaneous ovulators and the length of oestrous cycle in goats is 21days but this may vary highly. The oestrus behaviour is generally expressed for 36h but its duration may range from 24 to 48h. The duration of oestrus behaviour depends on the breed of goat, individual, age and presence of buck. Different hormonal regimens based on progestagens, PMSG, prostaglandins are being used for oestrus and ovulation synchronisation during both breeding and nonbreeding seasons. Meager literature is available on comparison of follicular dynamics in breeding and nonbreeding season in goats. Gestation length in goats averages about 149days but it may vary a little between breeds. Tropical goats have kidding potential round the year although they are not homogenously distributed throughout the year. Kidding (the act of parturition in goats) occurs at the end of gestation by a series of hormonal events. Male kids take about 20\% to 30\% longer time to be expelled. On average placenta are expelled 2.5h after the birth of last kid. The herdsman should be alert towards the pregnant goats that may kid whilst grazing as the newborn kids are not able to keep up with the rest of the flock and need to be carried home.},

	abstract = {Goat is the most geographically distributed livestock species due to its hardiness and adaptation to thrive in harsh environments. Goat keeping is an enterprise with the primary aims of maximising profit, creating wealth, and providing employment opportunities while providing animal protein in the form of meat and milk for human consumption, and supplying raw materials, hides, and fibres for the leather and clothing industries. Regular monitoring of productive performances through critical evaluation of some key indicators and reproductive parameters is essential to discover a deficiency in record keeping, overall flock management, and health problems. This helps to curtail financial losses sequel to poor performance. Reproductive parameters such as age at puberty, age at first kidding, kidding interval, and kid mortality rate and litter size are utilised to monitor the reproductive efficiency and productivity of the goat flock. Productivity indices that include kid birth weight, weight at puberty, carcass yield, milk output, and lactation length are monitored routinely and recorded appropriately and promptly for evaluation of production efficiency. Reproductivity and productivity indices are interconnected. The doe productivity index (expressed as weight per annum per doe) is simply a product of the doe reproductivity index and weaning weight (kg). Both are employed to summarise the overall performance of the flock. And a glance at them gives a clue to the economic viability of the goat production enterprise. Factors affecting goat productivity include stress, climate change, feed and nutrition, breeding, and breeding technology. Others are herd health, disease, and management. Management is paramount and is the hallmark of a productive goat enterprise as the coordinator of all other factors of production and the implementer of the right production strategies essentially required to enhance productivity.},

Algorithms were derived and computer programs tested with simulated data for 2,967 bulls and 50,000 markers distributed randomly across 30 chromosomes. Estimation of genomic inbreeding coefficients required accurate estimates of allele frequencies in the base population. Linear model predictions of breeding values were computed by 3 equivalent methods: 1) iteration for individual allele effects followed by summation across loci to obtain estimated breeding values, 2) selection index including a genomic relationship matrix, and 3) mixed model equations including the inverse of genomic relationships. A blend of first- and second-order Jacobi iteration using 2 separate relaxation factors converged well for allele frequencies and effects. Reliability of predicted net merit for young bulls was 63\% compared with 32\% using the traditional relationship matrix. Nonlinear predictions were also computed using iteration on data and nonlinear regression on marker deviations; an additional (about 3\%) gain in reliability for young bulls increased average reliability to 66\%. Computing times increased linearly with number of genotypes. Estimation of allele frequencies required 2 processor days, and genomic predictions required {\textless}1 d per trait, and traits were processed in parallel. Information from genotyping was equivalent to about 20 daughters with phenotypic records. Actual gains may differ because the simulation did not account for linkage disequilibrium in the base population or selection in subsequent generations.},

The flocks infected with GINs can undergo significant economic losses due to a decrease in productivity, the animals’ deaths, and the costs associated with treatments. The over-reliance on anthelmintics in the past years to eliminate GINs has resulted in the development of resistance against the available commercial anthelmintics. Genetically resistant animals can be used in mating systems to improve the overall flock resistance. This review aimed to summarize the estimated genetic parameters for resistance traits and genetic gains through the use of genetic/genomic selection for resistance to GINs in sheep. Heritability estimates from the literature ranged from 0.00 to 0.46 for fecal egg counts, 0.12 to 0.37 for packed cell volume/hematocrit, 0.07 to 0.26 for FAffa MAlan CHArt (FAMACHA©), from 0.10 to 0.37 for blood parameters, and 0.19 for Immunoglobulin A. Genetic correlations between traits measuring resistance to GINs and production traits ranged from negative to positive values in the literature. Genetic gains are possible when genetic/genomic selection for GIN resistance is applied. Therefore, genetic/genomic selection can be used to improve flocks’ resistance to GINs as a sustainable approach in sheep production systems.},

            This study aimed to identify differentially expressed (DE) long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in muscle tissue of Nellore cattle clustered by their fatty acid profile.
            Longissimus thoracis
            muscle samples from 48 young bulls were used to quantify fatty acid (FA) (myristic, palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, conjugated linoleic (CLA), α-linolenic and the groups of saturated fatty acids (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA), polyunsaturated (PUFA), ω3, ω6, PUFA/SFA ratio and ω6/ω3) and to generate RNA-Sequencing data for transcriptomic analyses. The
            K
            -means analysis was used to classify the 48 animals into three clusters based on their FA patterns. The C1 had significantly (p ≤ 0.05) higher PUFA, ω3, ω6, linoleic and α-linolenic content than C2 and C3. The proportion of MUFA, CLA and oleic in the C2 and C3 were significantly (p ≤ 0.05) higher in relation to C1, while C3 had significantly (p ≤ 0.05) higher proportions of ω6/ω3, SFA, myristic, palmitic and stearic proportion than C1 and C2. DE analyses were performed on three different comparisons, C1 vs. C2, C1 vs. C3 and C2 vs. C3, and 25, 28 and 22 DE lncRNAs (fold change {\textgreater} {\textbar} 2 {\textbar},
            p
            -value {\textless} 0.01 and false discovery rate (FDR) {\textless} 0.05) were found, respectively. For C1 vs. C2 comparison, a new transcript “
            lncRNA\_16456.3
            ” was found and was interacted with the genes
            FAM126A
            (Family with sequence similarity 126 member A) and
            IL6
            (Interleukin-6). These genes were enriched by GO biological function terms related to cellular response to lipid pathway. For the C1 vs. C3 comparison, the lncRNA "
            lncRNA\_13894.1
            " interacting with the
            BNIP3
            gene (BCL2/Adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3) was enriched by GO biological function terms related to fat cell differentiation. For the C2 vs. C3 comparison, a new transcript “
            lncRNA\_16618.6
            ” interacted with genes involved in G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Those genes play a crucial role in regulating lipolysis mediated by the cAMP signaling pathway and may be contributing to a higher PUFA fatty acid content in beef. For the three comparisons: C1 vs. C2, C1 vs. C3, and C2 vs. C3, the identified lncRNAs, including genic and intergenic (lincRNA were associated with genes affecting immune response, energy metabolism, lipid and FA metabolism, whose seem to play an essential role in the physiological processes related to meat quality. These findings provide new insights to better understand the biological mechanisms involved in gene regulation of FA composition in beef. This could be valuable for further investigation regarding interaction between lncRNAs and mRNAs and how these interactions may affect meat quality.},

Mapping genes that promote genetic resistance to mastitis could reduce the cost of antibiotic use and enhance animal welfare and milk production by improving outcomes of breeding for udder health. Using imputed whole-genome sequence variants, we carried out association studies for 2 traits related to udder health, udder index, and milking speed in Nordic Holstein cattle. A total of 4,921 bulls genotyped with the BovineSNP50 BeadChip array were imputed to high-density genotypes (Illumina BovineHD BeadChip, Illumina, San Diego, CA) and, subsequently, to whole-genome sequence variants. An association analysis was carried out using a linear mixed model. Phenotypes used in the association analyses were deregressed breeding values. Multitrait meta-analysis was carried out for these 2 traits. We identified 10 and 8 chromosomes harboring markers that were significantly associated with udder index and milking speed, respectively. Strongest association signals were observed on chromosome 20 for udder index and chromosome 19 for milking speed. Multitrait meta-analysis identified 13 chromosomes harboring associated markers for the combination of udder index and milking speed. The associated region on chromosome 20 overlapped with earlier reported quantitative trait loci for similar traits in other cattle populations. Moreover, this region was located close to the FYB gene, which is involved in platelet activation and controls IL-2 expression; FYB is a strong candidate gene for udder health and worthy of further investigation.},

We have identified the Fyn- and SLP-76–associated protein Fyb/SLAP as a new ligand for Ena/ vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) homology 1 (EVH1) domains. Upon TCR engagement, Fyb/SLAP localizes at the interface between T cells and anti-CD3–coated beads, where Evl, a member of the Ena/VASP family, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) and the Arp2/3 complex are also found. In addition, Fyb/SLAP is restricted to lamellipodia of spreading platelets. In activated T cells, Fyb/SLAP associates with Ena/VASP family proteins and is present within biochemical complexes containing WASP, Nck, and SLP-76. Inhibition of binding between Fyb/SLAP and Ena/VASP proteins or WASP and the Arp2/3 complex impairs TCR-dependent actin rearrangement, suggesting that these interactions play a key role in linking T cell signaling to remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton.},

Notably, genes related to production (CACNA1D, GHRHR), reproduction (ESR1, RBMS3), immunity (NOSTRIN, IL12B) and adaptation (ADAM22, ASL) were annotated to selection signatures. Gene pathway analysis revealed genes in insulin/IGF pathway for milk production, gonadotropin releasing hormone pathway for reproduction, Wnt signalling pathway and chemokine and cytokine signalling pathway for adaptation. This is the first study where selection signatures are identified using ddRAD-seq in indicine cattle breeds.

This study was conducted to determine genetic diversity of reproductive traits in a Mexican Braunvieh beef cattle population using single nucleotide polymorphisms in candidate genes. Information from 24 genes with 52 intra-genic loci reported in literature to be associated with productive life, pregnancy rate and cow and heifer conception rate of 150 Braunvieh males and females was considered. Observed heterozygosity (Ho) revealed high genetic diversity for the studied traits, Ho = 0.42 ± 0.087, relative to that of other populations of the same breed. Cluster analyses were carried out using the Ward and K-means algorithms. These analyses revealed high genetic diversity that was observed in the biplot of non-metric multi-dimensional scaling. It was found that clustering strategy allowed visualisation of distant groups by genotype but not by favourable alleles in all the loci. We found that the genes CSNK1E, DNAH11, DSC2, IBSP and OCLN affected most of the traits in our study and they were highly informative. Therefore, they represent a potential resource for selection and crossbreeding programs of the traits studied in Braunvieh. The analyses showed that the Mexican Braunvieh population has a high level of genetic diversity, arguably due to decades-long adaptation to the Mexican tropics.},

By using Fyb domains as bait to screen a mouse lymphoma cDNA library, we identified a novel interaction partner, mammalian actin binding protein 1 (mAbp1). We show that mAbp1 binds the Fyb N-terminal via its C-terminally located src homology 3 domain. The interaction between Fyb and mAbp1 is detected in macrophage lysates and the proteins co-localize with F-actin in the leading edge. Hence, mAbp1 is likely to constitute a downstream effector of Fyb involved in F-actin dynamics.},

	abstract = {Recent studies in breast cancer cell lines have shown that oncostatin M (OSM) not only inhibits proliferation but also promotes cell detachment and enhances cell motility. In this study, we have looked at the role of OSM signaling in nontransformed mouse mammary epithelial cells in vitro using the KIM-2 mammary epithelial cell line and in vivo using OSM receptor (OSMR)-deficient mice. OSM and its receptor were up-regulated approximately 2 d after the onset of postlactational mammary regression, in response to leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-induced signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3). This resulted in sustained STAT3 activity, increased epithelial apoptosis, and enhanced clearance of epithelial structures during the remodeling phase of mammary involution. Concurrently, OSM signaling precipitated the dephosphorylation of STAT5 and repressed expression of the milk protein genes β-casein and whey acidic protein (WAP). Similarly, during pregnancy, OSM signaling suppressed β-casein and WAP gene expression. In vitro, OSM but not LIF persistently down-regulated phosphorylated (p)-STAT5, even in the continued presence of prolactin. OSM also promoted the expression of metalloproteinases MMP3, MMP12, and MMP14, which, in vitro, were responsible for OSM-specific apoptosis. Thus, the sequential activation of IL-6-related cytokines during mammary involution culminates in an OSM-dependent repression of epithelial-specific gene expression and the potentiation of epithelial cell extinction mediated, at least in part, by the reciprocal regulation of p-STAT5 and p-STAT3.},

	abstract = {Prolactin and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) have different roles in the adult mammary gland, which are mediated in part by the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)5 and STAT3. In vivo studies have shown that STAT5 contributes to prolactin-dependent lobuloalveolar development and lactation whereas STAT3 mediates LIF-dependent epithelial apoptosis during postlactational involution. To understand the molecular basis of these STAT-dependent pathways, we demonstrate the ligand-independent effects of STAT5 and STAT3 in mammary epithelial cells in vitro and also identify the genes regulated by these related transcription factors. Thus, using conditionally active STAT3- or STAT5a-GyraseB fusion proteins, we observed that enforced and specific dimerization of STAT3 induced apoptosis whereas STAT5 induced differentiation of mammary epithelial cells. Furthermore, STAT5 attenuated apoptosis mediated by LIF, the physiological inducer of STAT3. Microarray analysis of STAT3- and STAT5-induced genes using this system demonstrated a marked specificity, which reflected their different physiological effects in vitro and in vivo. STAT5-specific gene targets included the milk protein genes α-casein and kallikrein-8 and the survival factors prosaposin and Grb10. STAT3-specific genes included the apoptosis regulators CCAAT enhancer binding protein-δ, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-regulatory subunits, purine nucleoside phosphorylase, and c-fos. These data illustrate that specific activation of STAT3 and STAT5 alone is sufficient to induce and suppress apoptosis, respectively, and that these transcription factors elicit their actions by inducing distinct subsets of target genes in mammary epithelial cells.},

The objectives of this study were to identify target genes containing SNP that may play a key role in the regulation of milk fat synthesis in cows resistant or sensitive to MFD. Four cows were selected from a dairy farm after a switch from a control diet to a linseed-rich diet; two were resistant to MFD with a high milk fat content in the control (4.06\%) and linseed-rich (3.90\%) diets; and two were sensitive to MFD with the milk fat content decreasing after the change from the control (3.87\%) to linseed-rich (2.52\%) diets. Transcriptome and SNP discovery analyses were performed using RNA-sequencing technology. There was a large number of differentially expressed genes in the control (n = 1316) and linseed-rich (n = 1888) diets. Of these, 15 genes were detected as key gene regulators and harboring SNP in the linseed-rich diet. The selected genes MTOR, PDPK1, EREG, NOTCH1, ZNF217 and TGFB3 may form a network with a principal axis PI3K/Akt/MTOR/SREBP1 involved in milk fat synthesis and in the response to diets that induced MFD. These 15 genes are novel candidate genes to be involved in the resistance or sensitivity of dairy cows to milk fat depression.},

However, the function of mTORC2 in lipid metabolism is not well understood. In the present study, mTORC2 was inactivated by the ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor AZD8055 or shRNA targeting RICTOR in primary bovine mammary epithelial cells (pBMECs). MTT assay was performed to examine the effect of AZD8055 on cell proliferation. ELISA assay and GC-MS analysis were used to determine the content of lipid. The mRNA and protein expression levels were investigated by RT/real-time PCR and western blot analysis, respectively. We found that cell proliferation, mTORC2 activation, and lipid secretion were inhibited by AZD8055. RICTOR was knocked down and mTORC2 activation was specifically attenuated by the shRNA. Compared to control cells, the expression of the transcription factor gene PPARG and the lipogenic genes LPIN1, DGAT1, ACACA, and FASN was downregulated in RICTOR silencing cells. As a result, the content of intracellular triacylglycerol (TAG), palmitic acid (PA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and other 16 types of fatty acid was decreased in the treated cells; the accumulation of TAG, PA, and DHA in cell culture medium was also reduced. Overall, mTORC2 plays a critical role in regulating lipogenic gene expression, lipid synthesis, and secretion in pBMECs, and this process probably is through PPARγ. This finding provides a model by which lipogenesis is regulated in pBMECs.},

The aim of the current work was to investigate if the variation of the sheep GHR, GHRHR, and IGF1 genes is associated with milk yield and quality traits. Three hundred eighty dairy Sarda sheep were genotyped for 36 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) mapping to these 3 loci, and records for milk yield and daily fat and protein yield, as well as for fat, protein, casein, lactose, and milk urea contents, pH, somatic cell score, logarithmic bacterial count, and milk energy were obtained. The linkage disequilibrium analysis was performed only for GHR, as both GHRHR and IGF1 had only 1 polymorphic SNP. Haplotype analysis revealed the existence of 7 haplotype blocks in GHR. Two haplotype blocks, including part of the intron 1 and the upstream region, were clearly separated from the remaining 5 blocks by SNP rs412986330, which may be a recombination hotspot. The latter 5 blocks were contiguous, spanning from intron 2 to exon 10. Statistical analysis revealed that the GHR polymorphism is significantly associated with milk traits for daily fat and protein yield and fat, milk urea, and lactose content. Moreover, variation in IGF1 was associated with milk protein and casein content. Data generated in this research provide new insights into the allelic effects of the ovine GHRHR, GHR, and IGF1 genes on milk production and quality traits, information that may be useful in gene-assisted selection programs.},

	abstract = {Long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) are defined as RNA transcripts that are longer than 200 nucleotides. By definition, these RNAs must not have open reading frames that encode proteins. Many of these transcripts are encoded by RNA polymerase II, are spliced, and are poly-adenylated. This final fact indicates that there is a trove of information about lincRNAs in databases such as the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), which is a repository for RNAseq and microarray data. Recent experiments indicate that there are upwards of 15,000 lincRNAs encoded by the human genome. The term “intergenic” refers to the identification of these transcripts from regions of the genome that do not contain protein-encoding genes. These regions coincide with what was once labeled as the “junk DNA” portions of our genomes, which, upon careful examination by whole genome RNA sequencing experiments, clearly encode RNA transcripts. LincRNAs also contain promoter- or enhancer-associated RNAs that are gene proximal and can be either in the sense or antisense orientation, relative to the protein-coding gene with which they are associated. In this review, we describe the functions of lincRNAs playing roles in biological processes such as gene expression control, scaffold formation, and epigenetic control.},

	abstract = {Seven years after the introduction of genomic selection in the United States, it is now possible to evaluate the impact of this technology on the population. Selection differential(s) (SD) and generation interval(s) (GI) were characterized in a four-path selection model that included sire(s) of bulls (SB), sire(s) of cows (SC), dam(s) of bulls (DB), and dam(s) of cows (DC). Changes in SD over time were estimated for milk, fat, and protein yield; somatic cell score (SCS); productive life (PL); and daughter pregnancy rate (DPR) for the Holstein breed. In the period following implementation of genomic selection, dramatic reductions were seen in GI, especially the SB and SC paths. The SB GI reduced from ∼7 y to less than 2.5 y, and the DB GI fell from about 4 y to nearly 2.5 y. SD were relatively stable for yield traits, although modest gains were noted in recent years. The most dramatic response to genomic selection was observed for the lowly heritable traits DPR, PL, and SCS. Genetic trends changed from close to zero to large and favorable, resulting in rapid genetic improvement in fertility, lifespan, and health in a breed where these traits eroded over time. These results clearly demonstrate the positive impact of genomic selection in US dairy cattle, even though this technology has only been in use for a short time. Based on the four-path selection model, rates of genetic gain per year increased from ∼50–100\% for yield traits and from threefold to fourfold for lowly heritable traits.},

A total of 1143 differentially expressed genes (DEG) due to treatment were detected. The Dynamic Impact Approach (DIA) analysis uncovered the most impacted and induced pathways “fatty acid elongation in mitochondria,” “glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis-keratan sulfate,” and “pentose phosphate pathway.” The data highlights the central role of PPARG in milk fatty acid metabolism via controlling fatty acid elongation, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acid, lipid formation, and lipid secretion; furthermore, its role related to carbohydrate metabolism promotes the production of intermediates required for milk fat synthesis. Analysis of upstream regulators indicated that PPARG participates in multiple physiological processes via controlling or cross talking with other key transcription factors such as PPARD and NR1H3 (also known as liver-X-receptor-α). This transcriptome-wide analysis represents the first attempt to better understand the biological relevance of PPARG expression in ruminant mammary cells.

	abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) based on high throughput SNP genotyping technologies open a broad avenue for exploring genes associated with milk production traits in dairy cattle. Motivated by pinpointing novel quantitative trait nucleotide (QTN) across Bos Taurus genome, the present study is to perform GWAS to identify genes affecting milk production traits using current state-of-the-art SNP genotyping technology, i.e., the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip. In the analyses, the five most commonly evaluated milk production traits are involved, including milk yield (MY), milk fat yield (FY), milk protein yield (PY), milk fat percentage (FP) and milk protein percentage (PP). Estimated breeding values (EBVs) of 2,093 daughters from 14 paternal half-sib families are considered as phenotypes within the framework of a daughter design. Association tests between each trait and the 54K SNPs are achieved via two different analysis approaches, a paternal transmission disequilibrium test (TDT)-based approach (L1-TDT) and a mixed model based regression analysis (MMRA). In total, 105 SNPs were detected to be significantly associated genome-wise with one or multiple milk production traits. Of the 105 SNPs, 38 were commonly detected by both methods, while four and 63 were solely detected by L1-TDT and MMRA, respectively. The majority (86 out of 105) of the significant SNPs is located within the reported QTL regions and some are within or close to the reported candidate genes. In particular, two SNPs, ARS-BFGL-NGS-4939 and BFGL-NGS-118998, are located close to the DGAT1 gene (160bp apart) and within the GHR gene, respectively. Our findings herein not only provide confirmatory evidences for previously findings, but also explore a suite of novel SNPs associated with milk production traits, and thus form a solid basis for eventually unraveling the causal mutations for milk production traits in dairy cattle.},

BLUP-EBVs were used for dairy yield (DY), fat percentage (FP), protein percentage (PP) and somatic cell score (SCS). 150 animals were selected for blood or semen DNA extraction and genotyping with BovineLD BeadChip (Illumina). Autosomal information was retained and the editing information was performed using Plink v1.07 software. The effects of SNPs were determined by Bayes C with GS3 software. The minor allele frequency for most of the markers on the bead chip was high, which increases the probability of finding important loci segregating in the population. Estimations of fraction markers with an effect were close to zero in almost all cases. The most important markers were mapped by trait using ENSEMBL. A total of 6,510 autosomal SNPs were retained, out of which only a proportion with effect was taken from the mixed function of Bayes C. Important genes as ANKS1B, CLCN1, NMBR and CTSD, were found for each trait for AL, FP, PP and SCS respectively. Finally, Bayes C estimation allowed to identify specific SNPs possibly associated with QTLs.},

	abstract = {Advances in DNA-based marker technology have enabled the identification of genomic regions underlying complex phenotypic traits in livestock species. The incorporation of detected quantitative trait loci into genetic evaluation provides great potential to enhance selection accuracies, hence expediting the genetic improvement of economically important traits. The objective of the present study was to investigate 96 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) located in 53 candidate genes previously reported to have effects on milk production and quality traits in a population of highly selected Holstein-Friesian bulls. A total of 423 semen samples were used to genotype the bulls through a custom oligo pool assay. Forty-five SNP in 32 genes were found to be associated with at least 1 of the tested traits. Most significant and favorable SNP trait associations were observed for polymorphisms located in CCL3 and AGPAT6 genes for fat yield (0.037 and 0.033 kg/d, respectively), DGKG gene for milk yield (0.698 kg/d), PPARGC1A, CSN1S1, and AGPAT6 genes for fat percentage (0.127, 0.113, and 0.093\%, respectively), GHR gene for protein (0.064\%) and casein percentage (0.053\%), and TLR4 gene for fat (0.090\%), protein (0.066\%), and casein percentage (0.050\%). Somatic cell score was favorably affected by GHR (−0.095) and POU1F1 (−0.137), and interesting SNP-trait associations were observed for polymorphisms located in CSN2, POU1F1, and AGPAT6 genes for rennet coagulation time (−0.592, −0.558, and −0.462 min, respectively), and GHR and CSN2 genes for curd firmness 30 min after rennet addition (1.264 and 1.183 mm, respectively). In addition to the influence of individual SNP, the effects of composite genotypes constructed by grouping SNP according to their individual effects on traits considered in the analysis were also examined. Favorable and significant effects on milk traits were observed for 2 composite genotypes, one including 10 SNP and the other 4 SNP. The former was associated with an increase of milk (0.075 kg/d), fat (0.097 kg/d), protein (0.083 kg/d), and casein yields (0.065 kg/d), and the latter was associated with an increase of fat (0.244\%), protein (0.071\%), and casein percentage (0.047\%). Although further research is required to validate the identified SNP loci in other populations and breeds, our results can be considered as a preliminary foundation for further replication studies on gene-assisted selection programs.},

	abstract = {Identification of genetic markers that affect economically important traits is of high value from a biological point of view, enabling the targeting of candidate genes and providing practical benefits for the industry such as wide-scale genomic selection. This study is one of the first to investigate the genetic background of economically important traits in dairy goats using the caprine 50K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip. The aim of the project was to perform a genome-wide association study for milk yield and conformation of udder, teat, and feet and legs. A total of 137,235 milk yield records on 4,563 goats each scored for 10 conformation traits were available. Out of these, 2,381 goats were genotyped with the Illumina Caprine 50K BeadChip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). A range of pseudo-phenotypes were used including deregressed breeding values and pseudo-estimated breeding values. Genome-wide association studies were performed using the multi-locus mixed model (MLMM) algorithm implemented in SNP \& Variation Suite v7.7.8 (Golden Helix Inc., Bozeman, MT). A genome-wise significant [−log10(P-value) {\textgreater} 5.95] SNP for milk yield was identified on chromosome 19, with additional chromosome-wise significant (−log10(P-value) {\textgreater} 4.46] SNP on chromosomes 4, 8, 14, and 29. Three genome-wise significant SNP for conformation of udder attachment, udder depth, and front legs were identified on chromosome 19, and chromosome-wise SNP were found on chromosomes 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 21, 23, and 27. The proportion of variance explained by the significant SNP was between 0.4 and 7.0\% for milk yield and between 0.1 and 13.8\% for conformation traits. This study is the first attempt to identify SNP associated with milk yield and conformation in dairy goats. Two genome-wise significant SNP for milk yield and 3 SNP for conformation of udder attachment, udder depth, and front legs were found. Our results suggest that conformation traits have a polygenic background because, for most of them, we did not identify any quantitative trait loci with major effect.},

	abstract = {This study is first to perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to investigate the milk quality traits in Karachai goats. The objective of the study was to identify candidate genes associated with milk composition traits based on the identification and subsequent analysis of all possible SNPs, both genome-wide (high-confidence) and suggestive (subthreshold significance). To estimate the milk components, 22 traits were determined, including several types of fatty acids. DNA was extracted from ear tissue or blood samples. A total of 167 Karachai goats were genotyped using an Illumina GoatSNP53K BeadChip panel (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Overall, we identified 167 highly significant and subthreshold SNPs associated with the milk components of Karachai goats. A total of 10 SNPs were located within protein-coding genes and 33 SNPs in close proximity to them (±0.2 Mb). The largest number of genome-wide significant SNPs was found on chromosomes 2 and 8 and some of them were associated with several traits. The greatest number of genome-wide significant SNPs was identified for crude protein and lactose (6), and the smallest number—only 1 SNP—for freezing point depression. No SNPs were identified for monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Functional annotation of all 43 SNPs allowed us to identify 66 significant candidate genes on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 13, 16, 18, 21, 23, 25, 26, and 27. We considered these genes potential DNA markers of the fatty acid composition of Karachai goat milk. Also, we found 12 genes that had a polygenic effect: most of them were simultaneously associated with the dry matter content and fatty acids (METTL, SLC1A 8, PHACTR1, FMO2, ECI1, PGP, ABCA3, AMDHD2). Our results suggest that the genes identified in our study affecting the milk components in Karachai goats differed from those identified in other breeds of dairy goats.},

Here, we have used two different GWAS approaches to analyse data from three lactations recorded in Murciano-Granadina goats. In Analysis 1, independent GWAS have been carried out for each trait and lactation, while a single longitudinal GWAS, jointly considering all data, has been performed in Analysis 2. In both analyses, genome-wide significant QTL for lactose percentage on chromosome 2 (129.77–131.01 Mb) and for milk protein percentage on the chromosome 6 (74.8–94.6 Mb) casein gene cluster region were detected. In Analysis 1, several QTL were not replicated in all three lactations, possibly due to the existence of lactation-specific genetic determinants. In Analysis 2, we identified several genome-wide significant QTL related to milk yield and protein content that were not uncovered in Analysis 1. The increased number of QTL identified in Analysis 2 suggests that the longitudinal GWAS is particularly well suited for the genetic analysis of dairy traits. Moreover, our data confirm that variability within or close to the casein complex is the main genetic determinant of milk protein percentage in Murciano-Granadina goats.},

	abstract = {Goats (Capra hircus) were domesticated during the late
Neolithic, approximately 10,500 years ago, and humans exerted minor selection
pressure until fairly recently. Probably the largest genetic change occurring
over the millennia happened via natural selection and random genetic drift, the
latter causing genes to be fixed in small and isolated populations. Recent
human-influenced genetic changes have occurred through biometrics and genomics.
For the most part, biometrics has concentrated upon the refining of estimates of
heritabilities and genetic correlations. Heritabilities are instrumental in the
calculation of estimated breeding values and genetic correlations are necessary
in the construction of selection indices that account for changes in multiple
traits under selection at one time. Early genomic studies focused upon
microsatellite markers, which are short tandem repeats of nucleic acids and
which are detected using polymerase chain reaction primers flanking the
microsatellite. Microsatellite markers have been very important in parentage
verification, which can impact genetic progress. Additionally, microsatellite
markers have been a useful tool in assessing genetic diversity between and among
breeds, which is important in the conservation of minor breeds. Single
nucleotide polymorphisms are a new genomic tool that have refined classical BLUP
methodology (biometric) to provide more accurate genomic estimated breeding
values, provided a large reference population is available.},

However, little is known about the regions of the genome that influence these traits in goats. We conducted a genome wide association study in French goats and identified 109 regions associated with dairy traits. For a major region on chromosome 14 closely associated with fat content, the Diacylglycerol O-Acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) gene turned out to be a functional and positional candidate gene. The caprine reference sequence of this gene was completed and 29 polymorphisms were found in the gene sequence, including two novel exonic mutations: R251L and R396W, leading to substitutions in the protein sequence. The R251L mutation was found in the Saanen breed at a frequency of 3.5\% and the R396W mutation both in the Saanen and Alpine breeds at a frequencies of 13\% and 7\% respectively. The R396W mutation explained 46\% of the genetic variance of the trait, and the R251L mutation 6\%. Both mutations were associated with a notable decrease in milk fat content. Their causality was then demonstrated by a functional test. These results provide new knowledge on the genetic basis of milk synthesis and will help improve the management of the French dairy goat breeding program.},

Indeed, it is widely accepted that estrogens are essential for growth of the MG to occur, both for ductal elongation during puberty and for alveolar development during gestation. As the factors regulating MG development continually come to light from the fields of developmental biology, lactation physiology, and breast cancer research, a growing body of evidence serves as a reminder that the MG are not as exclusively dependent on estrogens as might have been thought. The objective of this review is to summarize the state of information regarding our understanding of how estrogen (E) has been implicated as the key regulator of MG development, and to highlight some of the alternative E-independent mechanisms that have been discovered. In particular, we review our findings that dietary trans-10,cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid promotes ductal elongation and that the combination of progesterone (P) and prolactin (PRL) can stimulate branching morphogenesis in the absence of E. Ultimately, these examples stand as a healthy challenge to the question of just how important estrogens are for MG development. Answers to this question, in turn, increase our understanding of MG development across all mammals and the ways in which it can affect milk production.},

Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on total RNA extracted from milk somatic cells from ewes on days 10, 50, 120 and 150 after lambing. The experiment was performed in Spanish Churra and Assaf breeds, which differ in their milk production traits. Nearly 67\% of the annotated genes in the reference genome (Oar\_v3.1) were expressed in ovine milk somatic cells. For the two breeds and across the four lactation stages studied, the most highly expressed genes encoded caseins and whey proteins. We detected 573 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across lactation points, with the largest differences being found, between day 10 and day 150. Upregulated GO terms at late lactation stages were linked mainly to developmental processes linked to extracellular matrix remodeling. A total of 256 annotated DEGs were detected in the Assaf and Churra comparison. Some genes selectively upregulated in the Churra breed grouped under the endopeptidase and channel activity GO terms. These genes could be related to the higher cheese yield of this breed. Overall, this study provides the first integrated overview on sheep milk gene expression.},

All existing annotation types have been updated, if available, based on the new DAVID Gene system. Compared with the last version, the number of gene-term records for most annotation types within the updated Knowledgebase have significantly increased. Moreover, we have incorporated new annotations in the Knowledgebase including small molecule-gene interactions from PubChem, drug-gene interactions from DrugBank, tissue expression information from the Human Protein Atlas, disease information from DisGeNET, and pathways from WikiPathways and PathBank. Eight of ten subgroups split from Uniprot Keyword annotation were assigned to specific types. Finally, we added a species parameter for uploading a list of gene symbols to minimize the ambiguity between species, which increases the efficiency of the list upload and eliminates confusion for users. These current updates have significantly expanded the Knowledgebase and enhanced the discovery power of DAVID.,

In this study, we explored the influence of overexpression of growth hormone in the mammary gland on breast development and milk production in goats. Using transcriptome sequencing, we found that the number of highly expressed genes was greater in GH transgenic goats than non-transgenic goats. Furthermore, KEGG pathway analysis showed that the majority of the genes belonged to the MAPK signaling pathway and the ECM-receptor interaction pathway. The expression of genes related to breast development was further confirmed using qRT-PCR. Interestingly, both milk production and milk quality were increased. The results of these experiments imply that overexpression of growth hormone in the breast may stimulate breast development and enhances milk production by modulating alveolar cell proliferation or branching through the MAPK signaling pathway.},

Growth and maintenance of the mammary epithelium depends on the function of mammary stem cells and progenitor cells. In this review, we provide an overview of postnatal mammary gland development, cyclical phases of mammary gland regression (regression during lactation and between successive lactations), and mammary stem cells and progenitor cells.

The cows received 2 consecutive 21-d treatments (a daily s.c. injection of 3-mg GHRH analog or saline) in a 2 (group)×2 (period) Latin square crossover design. The 5 cows in group A received GHRH analog during period 1 (from d 22 to 42 postpartum) and saline during period 2 (from d 57 to 77 postpartum), and those in group B received saline and GHRH analog during periods 1 and 2, respectively. Mean milk yield decreased in saline treated compared with that during the 1-wk period before treatment 7.4 and 19.1\% during periods 1 (group B) and 2 (group A), respectively. Treatment with GHRH analog increased milk yield 17.4\% (period 1, group A) and 6.3\% (period 2, group B). Treatment with GHRH analog induced higher basal plasma concentrations of growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), insulin, and glucose compared with saline-treated cows. In glucose challenge, the GHRH analog-treated beef cows had greater insulin secretion than the saline-treated beef cows. In insulin challenge, however, there were no significant differences in the areas surrounded by hypothetical lines of basal glucose concentrations and glucose response curves between GHRH analog- and saline-treated cows. These results demonstrate that GHRH analog treatment facilitates endogenous GH secretion in lactating Japanese Black cows, leading to increases in milk yield and plasma concentrations of IGF-1, insulin, and glucose.},

	abstract = {Background Artificial and natural selection for important economic traits and genetic adaptation of the populations to specific environments have led to the changes on the sheep genome. Recent advances in genome sequencing methods have made it possible to use comparative genomics tools to identify genes under selection for traits of economic interest in domestic animals. Objectives In this study, we compared the genomes of Assaf and Awassi sheep breeds with those of the Cambridge, Romanov and British du cher sheep breeds to explore positive selection signatures for milk traits using nucleotide diversity (Pi) and FST statistical methods. Methods Genome sequences from fourteen sheep with a mean sequence depth of 9.32X per sample were analysed, and a total of 23 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were called and applied for this study. Genomic clustering of breeds was identified using ADMIXTURE software. The FST and Pi values for each SNP were computed between population A (Assaf and Awassi) and population B (Cambridge, British du cher, and Romanov). Results The results of the PCA grouped two classes for these five dairy sheep breeds. The selection signatures analysis displayed 735 and 515 genes from FST and nucleotide diversity (Pi) statistical methods, respectively. Among all these, 12 genes were shared between the two approaches. The most conspicuous genes were related to milk traits, including ST3GAL1 (the synthesis of oligosacáridos), CSN1S1 (milk protein), CSN2 (milk protein), OSBPL8 (fatty acid traits), SLC35A3 (milk fat and protein percentage), VPS13B (total milk production, fat yield, and protein yield), DPY19L1 (peak yield), CCDC152 (lactation persistency and somatic cell count), NT5DC1 (lactation persistency), P4HTM (test day protein), CYTH4 (FAT Production) and METRNL (somatic cell), U1 (milk traits), U6 (milk traits) and 5S\_RRNA (milk traits). Conclusions The findings provide new insight into the genetic basis of sheep milk properties and can play a role in designing sheep breeding programs incorporating genomic information.},

Improving LP is considered a good alternative method for increasing overall milk production because it does not cause the negative energy balance and other health issues that cows experience during peak milk production. However, little is known about the biology of LP. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) and pathway enrichment were used to explore the genetic mechanisms underlying LP. The GWAS was performed using a univariate regression mixed linear model on LP data of 3,796 cows and 44,100 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). Eight and 47 SNP were significantly and suggestively associated with LP, respectively. The 2 most important quantitative trait loci regions for LP were (1) a region from 106 to 108 Mb on Bos taurus autosome (BTA) 5, where the most significant SNP (ARS-BFGL-NGS-2399) was located and also formed a linkage disequilibrium block with 3 other SNP; and (2) a region from 29.3 to 31.3 Mb on BTA 20, which contained 3 significant SNP. Based on physical positions, MAN1C1, MAP3K5, HCN1, TSPAN9, MRPS30, TEX14, and CCL28 are potential candidate genes for LP because the significant SNP were located in their intronic regions. Enrichment analyses of a list of 536 genes in 0.5-Mb flanking regions of significant and suggestive SNP indicates that synthesis of milk components, regulation of cell apoptosis processes and insulin, and prolactin signaling pathways are important for LP. Upstream regulators relevant for LP positional candidate genes were prolactin (PRL), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG), and Erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (ERBB2). Several networks related to cellular development, proliferation and death were significantly enriched for LP positional candidate genes. In conclusion, this study detected several SNP, genes, and interesting regions for fine mapping and validation of candidate genes and SNP for potential use in selection for improved LP.

	abstract = {Background Artificial and natural selection for important economic traits and genetic adaptation of the populations to specific environments have led to the changes on the sheep genome. Recent advances in genome sequencing methods have made it possible to use comparative genomics tools to identify genes under selection for traits of economic interest in domestic animals. Objectives In this study, we compared the genomes of Assaf and Awassi sheep breeds with those of the Cambridge, Romanov and British du cher sheep breeds to explore positive selection signatures for milk traits using nucleotide diversity (Pi) and FST statistical methods. Methods Genome sequences from fourteen sheep with a mean sequence depth of 9.32X per sample were analysed, and a total of 23 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were called and applied for this study. Genomic clustering of breeds was identified using ADMIXTURE software. The FST and Pi values for each SNP were computed between population A (Assaf and Awassi) and population B (Cambridge, British du cher, and Romanov). Results The results of the PCA grouped two classes for these five dairy sheep breeds. The selection signatures analysis displayed 735 and 515 genes from FST and nucleotide diversity (Pi) statistical methods, respectively. Among all these, 12 genes were shared between the two approaches. The most conspicuous genes were related to milk traits, including ST3GAL1 (the synthesis of oligosacáridos), CSN1S1 (milk protein), CSN2 (milk protein), OSBPL8 (fatty acid traits), SLC35A3 (milk fat and protein percentage), VPS13B (total milk production, fat yield, and protein yield), DPY19L1 (peak yield), CCDC152 (lactation persistency and somatic cell count), NT5DC1 (lactation persistency), P4HTM (test day protein), CYTH4 (FAT Production) and METRNL (somatic cell), U1 (milk traits), U6 (milk traits) and 5S\_RRNA (milk traits). Conclusions The findings provide new insight into the genetic basis of sheep milk properties and can play a role in designing sheep breeding programs incorporating genomic information.},

	abstract = {Background
Mastitis is the most prevalent disease in dairy sheep with major economic, hygienic and welfare implications. The disease persists in all dairy sheep production systems despite the implementation of improved management practises. Selective breeding for enhanced mastitis resistance may provide the means to further control the disease. In the present study, we investigated the genetic architecture of four mastitis traits in dairy sheep. Individual animal records for clinical mastitis occurrence and three mastitis indicator traits (milk somatic cell count, total viable bacterial count in milk and the California mastitis test) were collected monthly throughout lactation for 609 ewes of the Greek Chios breed. All animals were genotyped with a custom-made 960-single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) DNA array based on markers located in quantitative trait loci (QTL) regions for mastitis resistance previously detected in three other distinct dairy sheep populations.

Results
Heritable variation and strong positive genetic correlations were estimated for clinical mastitis occurrence and the three mastitis indicator traits. SNP markers significantly associated with these mastitis traits were confirmed on chromosomes 2, 3, 5, 16 and 19. We identified pathways, molecular interaction networks and functional gene clusters for mastitis resistance. Candidate genes within the detected regions were identified based upon analysis of an ovine transcriptional atlas and transcriptome data derived from milk somatic cells. Relevant candidate genes implicated in innate immunity included SOCS2, CTLA4, C6, C7, C9, PTGER4, DAB2, CARD6, OSMR, PLXNC1, IDH1, ICOS, FYB, and LYFR.

Conclusions
The results confirmed the presence of animal genetic variability in mastitis resistance and identified genomic regions associated with specific mastitis traits in the Chios sheep. The conserved genetic architecture of mastitis resistance between distinct dairy sheep breeds suggests that across-breed selection programmes would be feasible.

	abstract = {The aim of this observational study was to identify the influence of key nongenetic factors such as month of kidding, parity, and litter size on milk yield and composition of Australian dairy goats throughout lactation. The study was conducted over 4 consecutive kidding seasons from June 2016 to March 2017. Data from 940 lactations of Saanen goats from a commercial herd were used to observe the effects of month of kidding, parity number, and litter size on total milk yield (L/goat) in early lactation (kidding to 90 d in milk; DIM), mid lactation (91–180 DIM), and late lactation (181–270 DIM), cumulative milk yield (from kidding to 270 DIM; CMY), average lactation length, proportion (\%) of does reaching their target lactation length (270 DIM), somatic cell count (SCC), and percentages of milk fat and protein in early lactation. The mean herd responses throughout the entire study were as follows: CMY = 519 L/goat; lactation length = 233 d, with 70\% of does reaching 270 DIM; milk fat = 4.2\%; milk protein = 2.9\%; and SCC = 6.2 × 105 cells/mL. Average milk production peaked in February and was lowest in June (2.4 vs. 1.8 L/goat per day, respectively). Milk yield was affected by month of kidding, parity number, and litter size in all phases of lactation. November kidders had the greatest CMY, and March kidders had the lowest CMY. March kidders had the shortest lactation length and the lowest proportion of does reaching 270 DIM. June kidders had the longest lactation length, whereas September kidders had the highest proportion of does reaching 270 DIM. Maximum milk yield was attained in third parity. Goats in fourth or greater parity had the shortest lactation length, the lowest proportion of does reaching 270 DIM, and the highest SCC. Goats delivering single kids had lower CMY, lower SCC, and higher percentages of fat and protein than does delivering multiple kids. Our findings indicate that milk yield was primarily influenced by month of kidding, and the effects of month of kidding on milk yield were accentuated during mid lactation. However, the effects of month of kidding on milk yield varied significantly among parities.},

	abstract = {As part of the development of a breeding programme for dairy goats
to support sustainable production in organic farming, the overall aim of the
present study was to identify traits that can be used as selection criteria
for lifetime productivity. The breeding goal is high lifetime productivity
with a good milk composition and a good level of robustness in the animals,
especially within grazing systems. The lifetime productivity traits analysed in this study were the
length of the animal's productive life (LPL), the lifetime efficiency (LEF), and the animal's milk yield efficiency with respect the total number of lactating days (EDM); the average fat and protein content over the animal's lifetime, the
fat-to-protein ratio (FPR), and the urea content (UC) were also included as indirect health traits and
potential indicators of robustness in dairy goats. The traits' influencing
factors, phenotypic and genetic correlations, and heritability were
examined. Furthermore, factors influencing milk yield in the first 120 d of lactation during the animal's first lactation were analysed. The aim of investigating
milk yield during the first lactation was to consider a connection between early
performance recoding in the life of an animal and LPL, LEF, and EDM. In
total, lactation and pedigree data from 9192 dairy goats of the common German Fawn (GF) and German White (GW) dairy
breeds were used. Prerequisites were
that the investigated birth cohorts had to have definitively completed their
lifetime production, and a high proportion of goats had to have completed
extended lactation. The data analysis showed that breed did not
influence milk yield. The age at first kidding, the average number
of kids born during the animal's lifetime, and the lactation length did influence the milk yield.
This applies to the milk yield during the first 120 d of the first
lactation as well as over the lifetime of an animal. Considering the
influencing factors, the results showed that LPL was genetically and
positively correlated with LEF and EDM (rg=0.65±0.06 and
0.29±0.07 respectively). The heritability of LPL, LEF, and EDM was
0.22±0.02, 0.29±0.03, and 0.44±0.03 respectively.
Regarding the lifetime milk composition, the heritability of protein and fat
content, FPR, and UC was 0.63±0.02, 0.52±0.02,
0.32±0.03, and 0.47±0.04 respectively. The heritability regarding the milk yield during
the first 120 d of the first lactation was 0.34±0.03. We found that the milk yield during the first 120 d of the first
lactation showed a genetic correlation with LPL, LEF, and EDM of 0.30±0.08, 0.82±0.04, and 0.89±0.03 respectively. In summary,
LPL, LEF, and EDM are suitable traits to indicate lifetime productivity in
dairy goats. An additional indicator for lifetime productivity could be the
milk yield during the first 120 d of the first lactation. Moreover, FPR and UC appear to be promising indicator traits for the health and robustness of dairy
goats. The present study showed the importance of considering extended
lactation in selective breeding programmes as well as the importance of modelling extended lactation in the
breeding value estimation.},

	abstract = {The economic importance of genetically improving feed efficiency has been recognized by cattle producers worldwide. It has the potential to considerably reduce costs, minimize environmental impact, optimize land and resource use efficiency, and improve the overall cattle industry’s profitability. Feed efficiency is a genetically complex trait that can be described as units of product output (e.g., milk yield) per unit of feed input. The main objective of this review paper is to present an overview of the main genetic and physiological mechanisms underlying feed utilization in ruminants and the process towards implementation of genomic selection for feed efficiency in dairy cattle. In summary, feed efficiency can be improved via numerous metabolic pathways and biological mechanisms through genetic selection. Various studies have indicated that feed efficiency is heritable, and genomic selection can be successfully implemented in dairy cattle with a large enough training population. In this context, some organizations have worked collaboratively to do research and develop training populations for successful implementation of joint international genomic evaluations. The integration of “-omics” technologies, further investments in high-throughput phenotyping, and identification of novel indicator traits will also be paramount in maximizing the rates of genetic progress for feed efficiency in dairy cattle worldwide.},

However, milk production and composition values differ at every stage of lactation in goats. Thus, determining the highest milk production and producing the best quality goat milk is essential to satisfy the local market demands. The objective of the present study is to determine the milk yield and milk composition at different lactation stages and to evaluate the lactation curves in Saanen goats. The lactation stages can be categorized into three, early (less than 80 days), mid (80 – 140 days) and late (over 140 days) days in milk (DIM). In total, 90 milk samples were collected from 15 goats representing early (n=5), mid (n=5), and late (n=5) stages of lactation. The Saanen goats were raised under the same conditions, and milking was done early in the morning (9.00am).The milk yield from Saanen goats were collected and measured weekly at each stage of lactation. Milk samples were analyzed for fat, protein, solid non-fat, and lactose. Current result illustrated, there were significant different (p ˂ 0.05) among three stages of lactation in milk yield, solid non-fat, fat, protein and lactose. In terms of food regulation, the Saanen goats almost fully met the standard requirements for milk production and composition. In addition, this study also observes the lactation curves in Saanen goats and analyse the curve shapes and patterns. The average milk yields from three different stages develops a concave downward curve. The results indicated that mid yield increased from early to mid- lactation and decreased thereafter until the end of lactation.},

First, principal component analysis classified the shape of the lactation curves into 3 principal components: the first component accounted for milk yield level throughout lactation, the second component accounted for lactation persistency, and the third component accounted for milk yield in mid-lactation. Then, from the principal component scores, the lactations were clustered into 5 different groups. Most lactations had a similar shape to the mean curve, except 30\% of the lactations that fell into 3 clusters that had a high production level at the peak and then a different persistency according to cluster. Estimated breeding value for milk yield and home region of breeding were the factors most related to lactation production level. Month of kidding, breed, and gestation stage had the biggest effect on persistency. Month of kidding was the factor most strongly linked to mid-lactation production.

	abstract = {Interest in dairy cow health continues to grow as we better understand health’s relationship with production potential and animal welfare. Over the past decade, efforts have been made to incorporate health traits into national genetic evaluations. However, they have focused on the mature cow, with calf health largely being neglected. Diarrhea and respiratory disease comprise the main illnesses with regards to calf health. Conventional methods to control calf disease involve early separation of calves from the dam and housing calves individually. However, public concern regarding these methods, and growing evidence that these methods may negatively impact calf development, mean the dairy industry may move away from these practices. Genetic selection may be a promising tool to address these major disease issues. In this review, we examined current literature for enhancing calf health through genetics and discussed alternative approaches to improve calf health via the use of epidemiological modelling approaches, and the potential of indirectly selecting for improved calf health through improving colostrum quality. Heritability estimates on the observed scale for diarrhea ranged from 0.03 to 0.20, while for respiratory disease estimates ranged from 0.02 to 0.21. The breadth in these ranges is due, at least in part, to differences in disease prevalence, population structure, data editing and models, as well as data collection practices, which should be all considered when comparing literature values. Incorporation of epidemiological theory into quantitative genetics provides an opportunity to better determine the level of genetic variation in disease traits, as it accounts for disease transmission among contemporaries. Colostrum intake is a major determinant for whether a calf develops either respiratory disease or diarrhea. Colostrum traits have the advantage of being measured and reported on a continuous scale, which removes the issues classically associated with binary disease traits. Overall, genetic selection for improved calf health is feasible. However, to ensure maximum response, first steps by any industry members should focus efforts on standardizing recording practices and encouragement of uploading information to genetic evaluation centres through herd management software, as high-quality phenotypes are the backbone of any successful breeding program.},

	abstract = {The importance of small ruminants to the dairy industry has increased in recent years, especially in developing countries, where it has a high economic and social impact. Interestingly and despite the fact that the mammary gland is the specialised milk production organ, very few authors studied the modifications occurring in the mammary gland through the lactation period in production animals, particularly in the small ruminants, sheep (Ovis aries) and goat (Capra hircus). Nevertheless, understanding the different mammary gland patterns throughout lactation is essential to improve dairy production. In addition, associating these patterns with different milking frequencies, lactation number or different diets is also of high importance, directly affecting the dairy industry. The mammary gland is commonly composed of parenchyma and stroma, which includes the ductal system, with individual proportions of each changing during the different periods and yields in a lactation cycle. Indeed, during late gestation, as well as during early to mid-lactation, mammary gland expansion occurs, with an increase in the number of epithelial cells and lumen area, which leads to increment of the parenchyma tissue, as well as a reduction of stroma, corresponding macroscopically to the increase in mammary gland volume. Throughout late lactation, the mammary gland volume decreases owing to the regression of the secretory structure. In general, common mammary gland patterns have been shown for both goats and sheep throughout the several lactation stages, although the number of studies is limited. The main objective of this manuscript is to review the colostrogenesis and lactogenesis processes as well as to highlight the mammary gland morphological patterns underlying milk production during the lactation cycle for small ruminants, and to describe potential differences between goats and sheep, hence contributing to a better description of mammary gland development during lactation for these two poorly studied species.},

Such studies can also provide information about the evolutionary processes involved in shaping genomes, as well as physical and functional information about genes/genomic regions. Domestication followed by breed formation and selection schemes has allowed the formation of very diverse livestock breeds adapted to a wide variety of environments and with special characteristics. The advances in genomics in the last five years have enabled the development of several methods to detect selection signatures and have resulted in the publication of a considerable number of studies involving livestock species. The aims of this review are to describe the principal effects of natural/artificial selection on livestock genomes, to present the main methods used to detect selection signatures and to discuss some recent results in this area. This review should be useful also to research scientists working with wild animals/non-domesticated species and plant biologists working with breeding and evolutionary biology.},

	doi = {10.1111/jbg.12863},
	abstract = {Estimating heritabilities with large genomic models by established methods such as restricted maximum likelihood (REML) or Bayesian via Gibbs sampling is computationally expensive. Alternatively, heritability can be estimated indirectly by method R and by maximum predictivity, referred to as MaxPred here, at a much lower computing cost. By method R, the heritability used for predictions with whole and partial data is considered the best estimate when the predictions based on partial data are unbiased relative to those with the complete data. By MaxPred, the heritability estimate is the one that maximizes predictivity. This study compared heritability estimation with genomic information using average information REML (AI-REML), method R and MaxPred. A simulated population was generated with ten generations of 5000 animals each and an effective population size of 80. Each animal had one record for a trait with a heritability of 0.3, a phenotypic variance of 10.0 and was genotyped at 50 k SNP. In method R, the heritability estimate is found when the expectation of a regression coefficient is equal to one. The regression is the EBV of selection candidates calculated with the whole dataset regressed on the EBV of candidates calculated from a partial dataset. In this study, we used the GBLUP framework and therefore, GEBV was calculated. The partial dataset was created by removing the last generation of phenotypes. Predictivity was defined as the correlation between the adjusted phenotypes of the selection candidates and their GEBV calculated from the partial data. We estimated the heritability for populations that included between three and 10 generations. In every scenario, predictivity increased as more data was used and was the highest at the simulated heritability. However, the predictivity for all data subsets and all heritabilities compared did not differ more than 0.01, suggesting MaxPred is not the best indication for heritability estimation. For the whole dataset, the heritability was estimated as 0.30 ± 0.01, 0.26 ± 0.01 and 0.30 ± 0.04 for AI-REML without genomics, AI-REML with genomics and method R with genomics, respectively. Heritability estimation with genomics by method R reduced timing by 83\%, implying a reduction in computing time from 9.5 to 1.6 h, on average, compared to AI-REML with genomics. Method R has the potential to estimate heritabilities with large genomic information at a low cost when many generations of animals are present; however, the standard error can be high when only a few iterations are used.},

	abstract = {Domestication and human selection have formed diverse goat breeds with characteristic phenotypes. This process correlated with the fixation of causative genetic variants controlling breed-specific traits within regions of reduced genetic diversity, so called selection signatures or selective sweeps. Using whole genome sequencing of DNA pools (pool-seq) from 20 genetically diverse modern goat breeds and bezoars, we identified 2,239 putative selection signatures. In two Pakistani goat breeds, Pak Angora and Barbari, we found selection signatures in a region harboring KIT, a gene involved in melanoblast development, migration, and survival. The search for candidate causative variants responsible for these selective sweeps revealed two different copy number variants (CNVs) downstream of KIT that were exclusively present in white Pak Angora and white-spotted Barbari goats. Several Swiss goat breeds selected for specific coat colors showed selection signatures at the ASIP locus encoding the agouti signaling protein. Analysis of these selective sweeps revealed four different CNVs associated with the white or tan (AWt), Swiss markings (Asm), badgerface (Ab), and the newly proposed peacock (Apc) allele. RNA-seq analyses on skin samples from goats with the different CNV alleles suggest that the identified structural variants lead to an altered expression of ASIP between eumelanistic and pheomelanistic body areas. Our study yields novel insights into the genetic control of pigmentation by identifying six functionally relevant CNVs. It illustrates how structural changes of the genome have contributed to phenotypic evolution in domestic goats.},

In this study, we systematically investigated the selection signatures in six phenotypically diverse goat breeds using SNPs obtained from pooled whole-genome resequencing data. More than 95.5\% of 446–642 million clean reads were mapped to the latest reference goat genome, which generated a sequencing depth ranging from 22.30 to 31.75-fold for each breed. A total of 5,802,307, 6,794,020, 7,562,312, 5,325,119, 8,764,136, and 9,488,057 putative SNPs were detected in Boer, Meigu, Jintang Black, Nanjiang Yellow, Tibetan, and Tibetan cashmere goats, respectively. Based on the genome-wide FST and expected heterozygosity scores along 100-kb sliding windows, 68, 89, 44, 44, 19, and 35 outlier windows were deemed as the selection signatures in the six goat breeds. After genome annotation, several genes within the selection signals were found to be possibly associated with important traits in goats, such as coat color (IRF4, EXOC2, RALY, EIF2S2, and KITLG), high-altitude adaptation (EPAS1), growth (LDB2), and reproduction traits (KHDRBS2). In summary, we provide an improved understanding of the genetic diversity and the genomic footprints under positive selection or the adaptations to the local environments in the domestic goat genome.},

	abstract = {Goats and sheep are versatile domesticates that have been integrated into diverse environments and production systems. Natural and artificial selection have shaped the variation in the two species, but natural selection has played the major role among indigenous flocks. To investigate signals of natural selection, we analyzed genotype data generated using the caprine and ovine 50K SNP BeadChips from Barki goats and sheep that are indigenous to a hot arid environment in Egypt’s Coastal Zone of the Western Desert. We identify several candidate regions under selection that spanned 119 genes. A majority of the genes were involved in multiple signaling and signal transduction pathways in a wide variety of cellular and biochemical processes. In particular, selection signatures spanning several genes that directly or indirectly influenced traits for adaptation to hot arid environments, such as thermo-tolerance (melanogenesis) (FGF2, GNAI3, PLCB1), body size and development (BMP2, BMP4, GJA3, GJB2), energy and digestive metabolism (MYH, TRHDE, ALDH1A3), and nervous and autoimmune response (GRIA1, IL2, IL7, IL21, IL1R1) were identified. We also identified eight common candidate genes under selection in the two species and a shared selection signature that spanned a conserved syntenic segment to bovine chromosome 12 on caprine and ovine chromosomes 12 and 10, respectively, providing, most likely, the evidence for selection in a common environment in two different but closely related species. Our study highlights the importance of indigenous livestock as model organisms for investigating selection sweeps and genome-wide association mapping.},

To uncover the genetic basis of LS, the genomic sequence of Jining Gray goat groups (one famous breed for high prolificacy in China) with LS 1, 2, and 3 for firstborn was analyzed, obtaining 563.67 Gb sequence data and a total of 31,864,651 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms loci were identified.

	abstract = {The Valdostana goat is an alpine breed, raised only in the northern Italian region of the Aosta Valley. This breed’s main purpose is to produce milk and meat, but is peculiar for its involvement in the “Batailles de Chèvres,” a recent tradition of non-cruel fight tournaments. At both the genetic and genomic levels, only a very limited number of studies have been performed with this breed and there are no studies about the genomic signatures left by selection. In this work, 24 unrelated Valdostana animals were screened for runs of homozygosity to identify highly homozygous regions. Then, six different approaches (ROH comparison, Fst single SNPs and windows based, Bayesian, Rsb, and XP-EHH) were applied comparing the Valdostana dataset with 14 other Italian goat breeds to confirm regions that were different among the comparisons. A total of three regions of selection that were also unique among the Valdostana were identified and located on chromosomes 1, 7, and 12 and contained 144 genes. Enrichment analyses detected genes such as cytokines and lymphocyte/leukocyte proliferation genes involved in the regulation of the immune system. A genetic link between an aggressive challenge, cytokines, and immunity has been hypothesized in many studies both in humans and in other species. Possible hypotheses associated with the signals of selection detected could be therefore related to immune-related factors as well as with the peculiar battle competition, or other breed-specific traits, and provided insights for further investigation of these unique regions, for the understanding and safeguard of the Valdostana breed.},

In this study, we evaluated selection signatures and genomic inbreeding coefficients, {\textless}italic{\textgreater}F{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{ROH}}$, based on runs of homozygosity (ROH), in six Ugandan goat breeds: Boer ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}n{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} = 13), and the indigenous breeds Karamojong ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}n{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} = 15), Kigezi ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}n{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} = 29), Mubende ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}n{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} = 29), Small East African ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}n{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} = 29), and Sebei ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}n{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} = 29). After genotyping quality control, 45,294 autosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) remained for further analyses. A total of 394 and 6 breed-specific putative selection signatures were identified across all breeds, based on marker-specific fixation index ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}F{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{ST}}$-values) and haplotype differentiation (hapFLK), respectively. These regions were enriched with genes involved in signaling pathways associated directly or indirectly with environmental adaptation, such as immune response (e.g., {\textless}italic{\textgreater}IL10RB{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} and {\textless}italic{\textgreater}IL23A{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}), growth and fatty acid composition (e.g., {\textless}italic{\textgreater}FGF9{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} and {\textless}italic{\textgreater}IGF1{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}), and thermo-tolerance (e.g., {\textless}italic{\textgreater}MTOR{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} and {\textless}italic{\textgreater}MAPK3{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}). The study revealed little overlap between breeds in genomic regions under selection and generally did not display the typical classic selection signatures as expected due to the complex nature of the traits. In the Boer breed, candidate genes associated with production traits, such as body size and growth (e.g., {\textless}italic{\textgreater}GJB2{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} and {\textless}italic{\textgreater}GJA3{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}) were also identified. Furthermore, analysis of ROH in indigenous goat breeds showed very low levels of genomic inbreeding (with the mean {\textless}italic{\textgreater}F{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{ROH}}$ per breed ranging from 0.8\% to 2.4\%), as compared to higher inbreeding in Boer (mean {\textless}italic{\textgreater}F{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{ROH}}$ = 13.8\%). Short ROH were more frequent than long ROH, except in Karamojong, providing insight in the developmental history of these goat breeds. This study provides insights into the effects of long-term selection in Boer and indigenous Ugandan goat breeds, which are relevant for implementation of breeding programs and conservation of genetic resources, as well as their sustainable use and management.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The major unsolved problem of descriptive population genetics is an adequate specification of the genetic difference between two closely related species as compared to the genetic difference between two populations of the same species. Traditional population genetic analyses deal with the distribution of allele frequencies between and within populations. From these frequencies several measures of population structure can be estimated, one of the most widely used being the genetic distance measures. Genetic distance is the degree of gene difference (genomic difference) between species or populations that is measured by some numerical method. Genetic distance measures have already been established as one of the major tools for analyzing data on gene differentiation between populations. Many genetic distances have been developed, of which a few remain in regular use. Each of these genetic distances has unique evolutionary and statistical properties, and evolutionary relationships inferred from each genetic distance can be quite different. Quantification of the genetic distance between populations is instrumental in many genetic research initiatives, and a large number of formulas for this purpose have been proposed. However, selection of an appropriate measure for assessing genetic distance between real-world human populations that diverged as a result of mechanisms that are not fully known can be a challenging task. In this study twenty six distance measures were investigated. For macroevolutionary comparisons, Nei's measures are probably the best. In microevolutionary studies, when sample sizes are approximately equal and the differences in gene frequency are great, Edward's E 2 is preferable. If sample sizes are quite variable and gene frequencies do not differ greatly, Sanghvi's G2 would be most appropriate.},

	abstract = {For most human complex diseases and traits, SNPs identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) explain only a small fraction of the heritability. Here we report a user-friendly software tool called genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA), which was developed based on a method we recently developed to address the “missing heritability” problem. GCTA estimates the variance explained by all the SNPs on a chromosome or on the whole genome for a complex trait rather than testing the association of any particular SNP to the trait. We introduce GCTA's five main functions: data management, estimation of the genetic relationships from SNPs, mixed linear model analysis of variance explained by the SNPs, estimation of the linkage disequilibrium structure, and GWAS simulation. We focus on the function of estimating the variance explained by all the SNPs on the X chromosome and testing the hypotheses of dosage compensation. The GCTA software is a versatile tool to estimate and partition complex trait variation with large GWAS data sets.},

	abstract = {Boar taint, an unfavorable odor in the meat of intact male pigs, is caused primarily by the accumulation of two compounds: androstenone and skatole. This multifactorial trait is regulated by numerous dietary, management and genetic factors. At the mechanistic level, there are many genes known to be involved in boar taint metabolism. Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) impacts boar taint through the phase I metabolism of skatole. The aim of this study was to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the CYP2E1 gene promoter and explore their relationship with the expression of CYP2E1 mRNA and protein. Sequencing of the promoter region using pools of genomic DNA identified seven promoter region SNPs at −159, −586, −1693, −1806, −2322, −2369 and −2514 bp upstream of the ATG start site. Genomic DNA was obtained from 65 boars from the three major swine breeds: Duroc, Landrace and Yorkshire, and individual animals were genotyped for the identified SNPs. RNA was isolated from liver tissue and quantitative PCR was performed to measure CYP2E1 gene expression, while levels of CYP2E1 protein in liver were measured by Western blotting. Significant within-breed variation in CYP2E1 protein and mRNA expression was observed, indicating significant differences in gene expression among individuals. However, levels of CYP2E1 mRNA and protein were not significantly correlated. Two SNPs within the promoter were significantly associated with CYP2E1 mRNA expression, but not with protein expression. This study provides evidence of additional mutations affecting the gene expression of CYP2E1 and suggests that factors that affect the differences in translation of CYP2E1 mRNA may also be important in affecting skatole metabolism.},

	abstract = {Dairy cattle routinely face a variety of stressors. For example, climate change has resulted in more frequent heat stress events that increase the incidence of bacterial infections by inducing conditions like leaky gut syndrome, whereby the integrity of the intestinal epithelium is compromised allowing for luminal bacteria and their membrane components to infiltrate the host’s bloodstream resulting in systemic inflammation. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a well-characterized and biologically relevant microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP) that makes up the outer membrane of pathogenic and commensal Gram-negative bacteria and is known to contribute to inflammatory disorders including mastitis, acidosis and septicemia. In the present study, Holstein heifers (n = 20) were randomly allocated into different treatment groups receiving saline, 100, 200 or 400 ng/kg of LPS intramuscularly to create an experimentally induced endotoxemic state. Serum was collected hourly for 8 hr and then again at 24 hr to profile changes in circulatory stress biomarkers. All LPS -challenged animals demonstrated distinct cortisol responses 2 hr post-LPS challenge, and in the 200 ng/kg and 400 ng/kg of LPS treatments cortisol concentrations remained significantly induced for up to 4 hr. Rectal temperature was significantly increased for heifers challenged with 100 and 200 ng/kg of LPS at 2 and 4 hr as compared to their pre-challenge temperature. All LPS-challenged animals demonstrated marked leukopenia and thrombocytopenia as compared to the saline control animals. A total of 8 cytokines, including TNFα, and IL-10, were found to be induced between 2 and 4 hr. Finally, we report that miR-1246, miR-223, miR-29 and miR-31 were significantly induced in animals challenged with LPS as compared to the saline controls. The present study demonstrated that the stress response in dairy heifers is dynamic and there are peak windows of time when cortisol, cytokines and also miRNA are induced, and blood cells are sequestered as part of the systemic inflammatory response. Variability in the response to LPS warrants further investigation in dairy cattle to better understand the contribution of genetics and associations between LPS-induced stress and health and performance.},

	abstract = {Development of ketosis in high-producing dairy cows contributes to several animal health issues and highlights the need for a better understanding of the genetic basis of metabolic diseases. To evaluate the pattern of differential gene expression in the liver of cows under negative energy balance (NEB), and under subclinical and clinical ketosis, a meta-analysis of gene expression and genome-wide association studies results was performed. An initial systematic review identified 118 articles based on the key words “cow,” “liver,” “negative energy balance,” “ketosis,” “expression,” “qPCR,” “microarray,” “proteomic,” “RNA-Seq,” and “GWAS.” After further screening for only peer-reviewed and pertinent articles for gene expression during NEB and clinical and subclinical ketosis (considering plasma levels of β-hydroxybutyrate), 20 articles were included in the analysis. From the systematic review, 430 significant SNPs identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were assigned to genes reported in gene expression studies by considering chromosome and base pair positions in the ARS-UCD 1.2 bovine assembly. Venn diagrams were created to integrate the data obtained in the systematic review, and Gene Ontology enrichment analysis was carried out using official gene names. A QTL enrichment analysis was also performed to identify potential positional candidate loci. Twenty-four significant SNPs were located within the coordinates of differentially expressed genes located on chromosomes 2, 3, 6, 9, 11, 14, 27, and 29. Three significant metabolic pathways were associated with NEB and subclinical and clinical ketosis. In addition, 2 important genes, PPARA (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha) and ACACA (acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase α), were identified, which were differentially expressed in the 3 metabolic conditions. The PPARA gene is involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism and fatty liver disease and the ACACA gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the carboxylation of acetyl-coenzyme A to malonyl-coenzyme A, which is a rate-limiting step in fatty acid synthesis. Gene network analysis revealed co-expression interactions among 34 genes associated with functions involving fatty acid transport and fatty acid metabolism. For the annotated QTL, 9 QTL were identified for ketosis. The genes FN1 (fibronectin 1) and PTK2 (protein tyrosine kinase 2), which are mainly involved in cell adhesion and formation of extracellular matrix constituents, were enriched for QTL previously associated with the trait “ketosis” on chromosome 2 and for the trait “milk iron content” on chromosome 14, respectively. This integration of gene expression and GWAS data provides an additional understanding of the genetic background of NEB and subclinical and clinical ketosis in dairy cattle. Thus, it is a useful approach to identify biological mechanisms underlying these metabolic conditions in dairy cattle.},

	abstract = {Fertility plays a key role in the success of calf production, but there is evidence that reproductive efficiency in beef cattle has decreased during the past half-century worldwide. Therefore, identifying animals with superior fertility could significantly impact cow-calf production efficiency. The objective of this research was to identify candidate regions affecting bull fertility in beef cattle and positional candidate genes annotated within these regions. A GWAS using a weighted single-step genomic BLUP approach was performed on 265 crossbred beef bulls to identify markers associated with scrotal circumference (SC) and sperm motility (SM). Eight windows containing 32 positional candidate genes and five windows containing 28 positional candidate genes explained more than 1\% of the genetic variance for SC and SM, respectively. These windows were selected to perform gene annotation, QTL enrichment, and functional analyses. Functional candidate gene prioritization analysis revealed 14 prioritized candidate genes for SC of which MAP3K1 and VIP were previously found to play roles in male fertility. A different set of 14 prioritized genes were identified for SM and five were previously identified as regulators of male fertility (SOD2, TCP1, PACRG, SPEF2, PRLR). Significant enrichment results were identified for fertility and body conformation QTLs within the candidate windows. Gene ontology enrichment analysis including biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components revealed significant GO terms associated with male fertility. The identification of these regions contributes to a better understanding of fertility associated traits and facilitates the discovery of positional candidate genes for future investigation of causal mutations and their implications.},

	abstract = {Asthma affects more than 300 million people worldwide and is increasing in prevalence. Asthma is most likely a common phenotype resulting from numerous combinations of genetic, environmental and age-related factors. Genetic variant studies have not come close to explaining the hereditability of asthma that is observed clinically. Such studies have been limited by disease heterogeneity, costs, and the complexity of the human DNA. Nonetheless, large-scale gene variant studies known as genome-wide association studies have identified asthma susceptibility loci that are both highly-significant and reproducible across populations. Several loci identified by these studies ended up being close to cytokines (e.g., IL-33 and TSLP) whose importance to asthma was perhaps underappreciated at the time. By directing both research and treatment efforts, these discoveries are already leading to new and improved therapies. At the same time, a gene expression signature identifying the Type 2 inflammatory response was identified in airway epithelial cells. This simple discovery has had important ramifications in patient phenotyping—a process that has advanced disease understanding and helped better personalize treatment recommendations. By connecting genetic variants to altered gene and protein expression, global gene expression will also have an important future role in connecting gene variants to disease mechanisms. By connecting DNA epigenetic changes to environmental and age-related factors, epigenetics will likely play a similarly important role in connecting environmental influences to disease. Although full of surprises and frustrations, genomic science offers excitingly new opportunities to greatly advance our understanding and treatment of asthma.},
